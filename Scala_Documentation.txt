Scala Features :
----------------

Functional Programming :
------------------------

Function has no Side Effects and 
The Function does what it is meant for.

Immutability:
-------------
If we have a variable in thousands of line of code and the variable has 
initialized in some function,If the function is giving incoorect resluts
then the problem would be incorrect value has been assigned to that variable in
the function.
We directly go to the instead of searching the whole code.

Scala Highly Encourages Immutability.

Composing Functions :
---------------------
Functions can be freely mixed with some other Functions to compose even more Functions.

High Order Functions :
----------------------
In addition to the Lego Style for mixing in Functiions,Functions in scala are by design
First Class Citizens.
In Scala we can create Higher Order Function that takes Other Functions as Parameters.

Pattern Matching :
------------------
No Functional Programming Language would be Complete without Pattern Matching.
We Can also achieve without Functional Programming.
In Big Data Processing 
We Load the Data in Segments or Partitions
We Filter for Some Entity
We Perform Some Computations on Entity
We again Filter Some More
We output or save the Results to the Database.

With Pattern Matching being a core Feature of Scala ,We can Pattern MAtch Pretty in Sacala.


Asynchronous and Paralell Programming :
---------------------------------------
Asynchronous Operations are greatly Simploified with the Help of Futures.


Dependency Injection:
---------------------
Dependency Injection in Scla can be acheived by Using Traits and Implicts.

Extensible Language :
---------------------
Scala Comes in with Built in Features like Implicits,Operator Overloading and Macros etc which
allows us to create other Domain Specific Language.

Scala Eco Sysytem:
------------------

Fundementals :
--------------
Variables and DataTypes
String Interpolation
Type Reference
If Else Statemenet
For Comparison
Range
While and DoWhile
Pattern Matching
Tuples
Option
Class and Type Hierarchy
Enumerations
