################################################### 1.Introduction to HTTP Request(procademy) #########################################

Here we wiil send an HTTP Request to the API which will fetch the data from the database and send the response with the Requested Data.
Here API can be Rest API,GraphQL API or any other API.
The response of an API will be the Json Data which can be used later in the Application.

The most important part of HTTP Request is the URL to which we are sending the Request.
It is also called as API End Point.
HTTP verbs defines which kind if request you want to send to that API i.e. GET,PUT,POST,DELETE etc.
Along with URL's and HTTP verbs we often need to send some additional metadata for the request which we are sending to the API.
These metadata is called as Headers of the Request.
These Headers are optional.
For some of the request's we also need to add the Body to the request.
The Body contains the data which we want to send the data to the Server.

################################################### 2.Setting up Firebase(procademy) ###################################################

Here we are going to use an existing backend solution provided by Google i.e. Firebase.
In Firebase we can create a database,store the data,fetch the data and delete the data.


	https://angular-backend-cd1f1-default-rtdb.firebaseio.com/
	
################################################### 3.Sending a Post Request(procademy) ################################################

To call the HTTP request we need to import HttpClientModule @angular/common/http and add it to the imports array.
In the Component to send the HTTPRequest pass it to the Constructor.

	constructor(private httpRequest:HttpClient){
	}
	
To send the Post Request to an API post() accepts three parameters i.e URL and the body and the Headers.


In the database it will create a folder called products and inside that folder all the products will be saved.
Here products Object will be automatically converts the Javascript Object into Json Object by this Post Method.

	  createProduct(products: {productName: string, description: string, price: string}){
		this.httpRequest.post('https://angular-backend-cd1f1-default-rtdb.firebaseio.com/products.json',products)
		.subscribe((response) =>{
		  console.log(response);
	  });
   
When we send the post request the Browser always sends two requests.
This is the default behavior of Browser.
One request will check whether the Request is allowed to send and If it is Success it will send the actual Request.
If we want to send the Headers along wit the Post Request
	
	createProduct(products: {productName: string, description: string, price: string}){
		const headers= new HttpHeaders({'smartschool':'srinivassankoji'});
		this.httpRequest.post('https://angular-backend-cd1f1-default-rtdb.firebaseio.com/products.json',products,{headers:headers})
		.subscribe((response) =>{
		  console.log(response);
		});
	}
