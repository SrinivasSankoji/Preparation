Introducing Spring Cloud :
**************************
Spring Cloud is Not a Single Project rather it is a Cluster of projects.
Spring Cloud Provides a libraries for Developers to Quickly build Some of the Common Patterns in distributed System.

Some of Them are :

Service Discovery
Circuit Breaker
Configuration Management
Intelligent Routing
Proxy
Control Bus
One Time Token
Global Locks
Leadership Election
Distributed Sessions
Cluster State

Some of The projects under Spring Cloud Umbrella are :

Spring Cloud Netflix
Spring Cloud Config
Spring Cloud Bus
Spring Cloud Bootstrap
Spring Cloud Function 
Spring Cloud Task

Spring Cloud Netflix : 
---------------------- 
Netflix was the First Organization to work around with Micro Services. 
Most of the Projects under Netflix are made open Source for public Use. 
Some of them are Eureka,Hystrix,Zuul,Consul and so on.

Spring Cloud Config :
---------------------
This Project Provides a Centralized Configuration Management for Making use of GIT or SVN.

Spring Cloud Bus :
------------------
This Makes the Micro Service and Infrastructure Components to Communicate with each Other in a distributed Set Up.

Challenges in a Micro Services Architecture :
*********************************************

Configuration Management :
**************************
In a System With Micro Services Architecture,Large Number of Micro Services has to Communicate With Each Other.
Each Micro Service has to Run in Multiple Environments and to Scale the Application more no of Instances of Each Micro Service runs in Multiple Environments.
Here Operations Team has to Maintain all the Configuration Management Details.
Spring Cloud Config Server Provides a Solution for Configuration Management by Maintaining all the Configuration details in GIT Repository.
Spring Cloud Config Server then Provides all the Information to Micro Services.

Dynamic Scale Up And Down :
***************************
Consider the Scenario where Micro Service A has to Communicate with Micro Service B.
Currently there are 3 Instances of Micro Service B are Running.
It is Possible that at any Point of Time,Number of Instances of Micro Service can be Added or Removed.
Requirement is we need to dynamically find out The Number of Micro Service B Instances are Running.

Service Registration :
----------------------
All The Micro Services has to register with Naming Server and Spring Boot Provides Eureka Server.

Service Discovery:
------------------
When One Micro Service wants to Communicate with Another Micro Service,Then Calling Micro Service Communicates with 
Service Registry (Eureka Server) about The Instances of that Micro Service and Eureka Server Provides the URL to the Calling
Micro Service.
This Helps in Providing Dynamic Relation Ship of the Micro Service.

Load Balancing :
----------------
When Multiple Instances of The Same Micro Service are Running and want to distribute The load Between them.
Spring Cloud Provides a Client Side Load Balancing Using Ribbon Framework.

Visibility and Monitoring :
***************************
In Micro Service Architecture we need to have complete visibility on what is Happening in Our Micro Services.
In Order to Trace the Request,We need to have a Unique Identifier for Each and Every Request.
Spring Cloud Sleuth helps in assigning a Unique Identifier to each and Every Request.
We can use a distributed tracing Solution Like Zipkin to trace the request across Multiple Components.

API Gateway :
-------------
All the Micro Services have Some Common Features Like Security,Logging and Analytics.
API Gateway Provides a great Solution to Implement this Common Features and some of them are 

Netflix Zuul API Gateway.
Spring Cloud Gateway
Ribbon
Open Feign

Fault Tolerance :
-----------------
What If Micro Services Goes Down.
Hystrix helps in Improving Fault Tolerance.
