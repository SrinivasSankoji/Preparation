S3 stands for simple storage service.
S3 is like virtual drive using which we can store and retrieve any amount of data at any point of time.
S3 is an Object based storage service for uploading files.
File can be of any size from 0 Bytes to 5 Terra Bytes and the storage capacity is effectively unlimited.
Amazon will continuously increase the size at the back end.
It is used in Applications like Dropbox that allows user to store files of different types in a cloud based File system.

When a file is uploaded to S3 it will be stored in a Bucket.
Bucket is just like a folder or repository which will hold all the sub folders and files.
S3 has a universal namespace i.e. each Bucket we created must have unique name which is not being used by anyone in the world.
This is because Bucket name makes up part of the S3 URL which must be unique.

Reading and Writing data to and from S3 :
-----------------------------------------
When a file is uploaded to S3, it has read and write efficiency. 
This means once the file is successfully written to S3, it is immediately available for reading anywhere in the world. 
Additionally, S3 now offers strong consistency for both read-after-write and read-after-update/delete operations, 
ensuring that updates or deletions are immediately reflected in subsequent read operations.

Storage Classes :
-----------------
Data Stored in S3 can be held in 4 Storage Classes.

Standard S3 :
This is the most durable Storage Class.
If the files are accessed frequently and requires quick access.

S3 InFrequently Accessed :
If the files are accessed less frequently and still available for us.

S3 Redundancy Storage :
This can be used for the data that can be reproduced such as Auto generated Docs.

Glacier :
This can be used for data archive.We can hold the data here with low cost.
However we have to wait upto 3 to 5 hours for Data access.

Files are stored with the following attributes
Key : 		Filename
Value : 	File Data
VersionId : If the Versioning is turned on,we can keep track of the Current version.Versioning will store all the versions of an Object and is useful for Backup's.
Metadata :	Data about the Data i.e. uploadTime,LastAccessedTime etc.

S3 LifeCycle Management :
---------------------------
As the data ages within S3,we can set up the flow through each of the Storage classes in order to reduce costs.
For example, the data that is old can be put into Glacier.
Life Cycle Management can be applied to current and previous versions of files.
We can move the files into S3 IA after atleast 30 Days and then into Glacier another 30 days.
So to move the files into Glacier files it needs atleast 60 Days in both S3 Standard and S3 IA.
These numbers are user configurable but can't be below the minimum of 30 days.

 
####################################################### 2.S3 Introduction (AWS and More) #######################################################

By default, S3 bucket blocks all public access, and we must explicitly unblock and configure permissions to allow public access. 
Similarly, when files are uploaded to S3, they do not have public access by default, and you must manually grant public access to those files if needed.

####################################################### 3.S3 Introduction (Dhaval Nagar) #######################################################

By default we can create 100 S3 Bukcets in each AWS Account.
S3 Buckets are HTTP enabled so that we can access the Object stored inside the Bucket with a unique URL.

Version Control :
-----------------
By default, a GET request will retrieve the latest version of an object in S3. 
Older versions of an object can be retrieved by specifying the version ID in the request. 
When a user performs a DELETE operation on an object, unversioned requests will no longer retrieve that object, 
but all versions of the object will continue to be preserved in the S3 bucket. 
Only the owner of the S3 bucket or an authorized user with the necessary permissions can permanently delete a specific version of an object

Note :
Once the versioning is enabled It can only be suspended but cannot be disabled.
S3 considers each version of the Object as a seperate Object for billing.

S3 Lifecycle Management :
-------------------------
As the Data Ages within S3,we can set up the flow through each of the Storage Classes In order to reduce Costs.
So the Data that is old can be put into Glacier for example.
Life Cycle Management can be applied to Current and Previous versions of Files.
We can move the Files into S3 IA after atleast 30 Days and then into Glacier another 30 Days.
So to move the Files into Glacier Files have to be atleast 60 Days in S3 Storage and S3 IA.
These Numbers are User Configurable but can't be below the Minimum of 30 Days.

S3 Transfer Acceleration :
--------------------------
AWS S3 Transfer Acceleration enables fast,easy and secure transfer of files over long distance between our client and S3 Bucket.
Consider the scenario of video sharing Application.
User's from differnt parts of the world can upload the data into S3.
If we have single server collecting the data then different user's have different latency.
Here S3 Acceleration helps us to use the AWS Edge Location to upload the data into the nearest Data Center and sync back to the original Bucket via Internal LInk.

S3 is extremely cost effective.Cost decreases the more that we store on S3.
When we perform GET request It is cost effective.
S3 is replicating the Bucket and its content across the availability zones.

Why S3 :
--------
S3 is cheap and reliable way to store Objects.
Low Latency and high throughput.
Used to host static Websites.
Can Integrate with SNS,SQS,Lambda for powerful event driven Applications.
S3 has mechanism to shift away old data into long term storage for cost reduction.

Create Bucket :
---------------
Create Bucket --> Bucket Name i.e. Should not contain Uppercase and Special Characters. 
Select all the default Values.
After creating the Bucket --> Upload the File.

Note :
Make the Bucket and Object as public to access it from the Internet.

S3 Lifecycle Rules :

Create Lifecycle Rule :

Upload to S3 from Lambda :

S3 Buckets and Objects Public :

Copy S3 Files between Buckets :

Features of S3 are :
Durability
Availability because it is replicated into 3 Availability Zones
Scalability
Reliable
Faster
Cost effective
Secure because of Encryption. We can also provide custom Encryption.
Easy Interface for Data Transfer
Easy Integration with other services
Eventual Read after update/delete consistency.

Usecases for S3 :
Data Archiving
Data Lake for analytics purpose
Hybrid Cloud storage

Fundementals :
Bucket is a Container which stores the objects uploaded to S3.
Create a Bucket in region.But to optimize the Cost choose the near by region.
We can create Folders in the Bucket but there is no Explorer.It is a logical arrangement of the Objects.
Key
URL which can be used to access the content of the S3 Bucket.
We can also enable versioning.

Objects :
Objects are the fundemental entities which may be excel,word,video etc.
S3 Bucket consists of Object data and Meta data.

EndPoints :
AWS offers a regional end point to reduce latency.
Every Object has one key which is unique identifier.
Combination of Key and versionId identifies each Object in S3.

Practice :
Create Bucket
Versioning
Permissions
Access
URL
