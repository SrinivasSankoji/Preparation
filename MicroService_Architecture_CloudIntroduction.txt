Need For Cloud :
****************
Loads on Application are Not Consistent Throughout the Year.

1.Consider a Start Company which has the Potential to Grow Very Fast.
2.Consider an On-line Shopping Portal,which Customer Load varies throughout the Year
3.Insurance Company which has Peak Load at Particular Time

If we Provide an Infrastructure that supports the System at Peek Time and what about at the Rest of The Time.
Rest of the Time it would be Sitting Idle and Wasting the Resources.
Cloud Makes a Provision Infrastructure that Handles at the Peek Time and Release when it is not Required.

Building Applications for the Cloud :
*************************************
We Cannot take any Application and Just Put it on the Cloud.
There are Best Practices to Develop Such Cloud Native Applications and This is also Known as Twelve Factor Application.
Best Practice For Making Cloud Native Applications are 12 Factor Applications.

Advantages of the Cloud :
*************************
Auto Scaling and Agility :
--------------------------
There is No Need to Increase the Infrastructure at the Time of Peak Load.It will do on Demand.

Cost Reduction :
----------------
Pay for what we Use.

Scalability and Elasticity:
---------------------------
When the Applications are Built Very well,They Can Auto Scale Based on Demand.

Reliability:
------------
We Can Built a Micro Service With Fault Tolerance Built into Them that Makes the Application Reliable.

Manifestations of the Cloud :
*****************************
IAAS :
------
Infrastructure as Service is the First Level of Cloud.Here it only Provides the Hardware needed to run the Application.

PAAS:
-----
Platform as Service is the Next Level of Cloud.It Provides a Platform i.e Operating System or Managed Software
on Top of Hardware.

SAAS:
-----
Software as Service is third Level of Cloud,Where the Cloud Provider Provides a Software Product 
on the Cloud.
