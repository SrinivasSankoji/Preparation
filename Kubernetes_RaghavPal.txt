***********************************************************  1.Kubernetes Introduction	***********************************************************

Kubernetes is a Container Management tool or Container Orchestration tool.
Kubernetes was developed by Google Lab and later donated to CNCF (Cloud Native Computing Foundation).
Kubernetes is open source and written in GO Language.

Container Management tool manages Containerized Application.
Container Management tool or Container Orchestration tool automates deploying,scaling and managing containerized application on a group of servers.
Kubernetes is a Container Management tool that manages Containerized Applications i.e Applications available on Container platform like Docker.

Different processes that takes care in the process of Container Management are

Deploying
Scheduling
Scaling
Load Balancing

In an Enterprise Application we use large number of Container's and we need to ensure

Deployment or RollOut's
Availability
Load Balancing
Scale up and Scale down based on user Load.
Batch Execution
Rollbacks
Monitoring

All these process will be very difficult when we perform it manually.we need a tool that takes care of automating all the above process.
Tools are Kubernetes,Docker swarm,Apache Mesos.

*********************************************************** 2.Kubernetes Features Part One  ***********************************************************

Container tool like Docker will create the Containers where as Container Management tool like Kubernetes will manage the Containers in a distributed Manner.

Features of Kubernetes are

1.Automatic bin packing
2.Service Discovery and Load Balancing
3.Storage Orchestration
4.Self Healing

5.Automated Rollouts and Rollbacks
6.Secret and Configuration Management
7.Batch Execution
8.Horizontal Scaling


1.Automatic bin packing :
-------------------------
Consider the case we have 5 Servers and each Server has the Capacity of 10 GB (RAM).
We have a list of Jobs(Containers) to run on these 5 Servers in the most efficient way so that we do not compromise the resources.
Every Job has different resource(Memory) requirement.
Kubernetes will take care of packaging these jobs(Containers) in bins(Servers) in the most efficient way.
Kubernetes places the Containers based on their resources requirements like CPU & Memory (RAM) while not sacrificing availability by saving Resources.

In Kubernetes we do not interact with the Container directly.
Containers are wrapped into a Single functional unit called Pod.
Pods can contain a Single Container or Multiple Containers.
Pods are hosted inside Node.

When we specify a Pod we can optionally specify how much CPU and Memory(RAM) each Container needs.
When Containers have resource requests specified,the Kubernetes scheduler can make better decission about in which Node Pod has to be placed.

2,Service Discovery and Load Balancing :
----------------------------------------
Kubernetes does not run the Container directly instead it wraps one or more Containers into a higher level structure called Pod.
Pods can contain a Single Container or Multiple Containers.
Every Pod has a unique IP Address.

We can have multiple Pods in the Node.
Pods have the same set of functions that are abstracted into sets called Services.
Kubernetes Service is a set of Pods that work together.
Kubernetes provide a Single DNS Name for a Set of Pods and can laod balance across them.
With this System Kubernetes has Complete control over the network and communication between Pods and can handle laod balance between the Pods.

3.Storage Orchestration :
-------------------------
Containers that are running inside a Pod may need some storage option.
Pods can have a Storage Volume.
Usually a Single Volume is shared within all the Containers in the Pod.

Kubernetes allows us to mount the Storage System of our Choice.
Local
Cloud
NFS(Network File System)

4.Self Healing :
----------------
Kubernetes will take care of lot of processing to monitor the Applications.
If the Container fails,Kubernetes will take care of restarting the Container.
If the Node goes down,Kubernetes will replace and reschedule the Pods on the other Available Node.
Kubernetes has a Monitoring System that will check all the Containers.
If any Container does not respond to the Monitoring System or the user defined health check,Kubernetes will kill the Container and will take care of availability of the Application.
The process that takes care of all these steps is called Replication Controller.

***********************************************************  3.Kubernetes Features Part Two   *********************************************************** 

5.Automated Rollout's and Rollback's :
--------------------------------------
Kubernetes can manage Rollout's and Rollback's in an Automated way.
Whenever we make any changes to the Application  i.e by adding new Features to the Application to deploy is called RollOut.
Whatever new changes that has been made to the Application and has to revert is called Rollback.

Kubernetes progressively rolls out the changes to the Application or its Configuration,
while monitoring Application Health to ensure that it does not kill all the instances at the same time.
If something goes wrong Kubernetes will roll back the changes and ensures there is no downtime during the process.

6.Secret and Configuration Management :
---------------------------------------
In Kubernetes we have two objects i.e Secrets and Config Maps.

Secrets :
---------
In Kubernetes sensitive data like passwords,keys,tokens are handled using Secrets.
Secrets is a Kubernetes Object created Outside Pods.

Config Maps:
------------
In Kubernetes Configuration is handled using Config Maps.
Config Maps is a Kubernetes Object created Outside Pods.

Advantage of Secrets and Config Maps is that these are created outside the Pods so that they are portable and easy to manage.
Seperates the sensitive data and Configuration from the Container.
It also helps in deploying and updating the Application Configuration without rebuilding the image and without exposing secrets in stack Configuration.
Secrets and Config Maps are stores in ETCD.
ETCD is a key value data store or database.
Max Size limit for Secrets is 1 MB.

7.Batch Execution :
-------------------
Batch Jobs requires an executable or a process to run to its completion.
In Kubernetes run to completion jobs are primarily used for batch processing.
Each Job creates one or mode Pods.
During Job Execution If any Container or Pod fails Job Controller will reschedule the Container,Pods on another Node.
Batch Job can also run Multiple Pods in paralell and scale up if required.
Once the Job is completed,the Pods will be moved from running state to shut down state.
Batch execution in Kubernetes supports long running Jobs and replaces failed Containers.

8.Horizontal Scaling :
----------------------
In Kubernetes we can scale up and scale down the Containers.
scale up means creating more Replica's of the Container if required and scale down means kill the Containers if not required.
Scale up and Scale down of Containers can be created in multiple ways.

Using Commands
Using Dashboard (Kubernetes)
Based on CPU Usage

There are three tools in Kubernetes called 

Replication Controller
Manifest File
Horizontal Pod AutoScaler

Replication Controller is a structure that enables to create Multiple Pods and makes sure that these number of Pods always exist.
If any Pod crashes,Replication Controller will replaces it.
Replication Controller gets the information about the Number of Pods to create and make available always from a file called manifest file.
In the Manifest file there is a variable called Replica and it denotes the count of the Replica.
Replication Controller also called as rc or rcs,ensures that desired number of Pods are maintained always.

Horizontal Pod Autoscaler will monitor the CPU Utilization with a Custom Metrics and sends the Message to the Replication Controller to set the Number of Pods Required.
Based on this Replication Controller will maintain the number of Pods.
There is a Controller Manager in Horizontal Pod Auto Scaler which loops every 15 Seconds.
It keeps on Monitoring the CPU Usage and based on those Metrics it will sends the signal to the Replication Controller to maintain the number of Pods.


***********************************************************  4.Kubernetes Architecture Part One  ***********************************************************  

In an Organization we have a Manager,Manager manages the Team Members and together they form the Team.
In Kubernetes we have a Master and Worker Nodes together they form a Cluster.
When we set up Kubernetes we get a Cluster and Cluster is a Set of Machines called Nodes.
A Cluster has atleast one worker Node and atleast one Master Node to form a Cluster.
There can be more than one Master Node in a Cluster to provide a Cluster with fail over and high availability.
There can be Multiple Clusters in Kubernetes Architecture.

Node can be 

Physical Machine
Virtual Machine
VM on Cloud

Worker Nodes host the Pods that are the Components of the Application.
Master Nodes manages the Worker Nodes and Pods in the Cluster.

Kubernetes can support Clusters with upto 5000 Nodes.
Limit of Pods in a Cluster is 1,50,000.
Limit of Containers in a Cluster is 3,00,00.
For a Single Node there cannot be more than 100 Pods.


***********************************************************  5.Kubernetes Architecture Part Two  *********************************************************** 

When we Set up Kubernetes we get a Cluster.
Cluster has a Master and Worker Node.
In a Worker Node there may be one or More Pods.
Inside Pods there may be one or More Containers.
In a Cluster we can have multiple Worker Nodes and one or many Master Nodes.
Master Node contorls the Worker Nodes.

Master Node is responsible for Managing the Cluster.
Master Node monitors the Worker Nodes and Pods in the Cluster.
Whenever there is a failure of the Node,it will move the workload to the other working Node.
Master Node will take care of the overall working of the Kubernetes Cluster.

Master Node has 4 Components 

1.API Server
2.Scheduler   
3.Controller Manager
4.ETCD

1.API Serevr :
--------------
API Server is responsibele for all the communication on the Kubernetes.
API Server exposes some API's that a user can interact i.e To interact with API Server we use some API's.
To call the API Server we use a command line tool called kubectl or UI (Kubernetes Dashboard).
kubectl is the command line utility to interact with Kubernetes API.
kubectl is a Go Language Libraray.

2.Scheduler :
-------------
Scheduler is a Component that schedules the Pods across multiple Nodes.
Worker Nodes can be physical Machine or virtual Machine and can have different infrastructure or Hardware Configurations.
Scheduler knows about these Hardware Configurations of Nodes.
Whenever Scheduler has scheduled a Pod,it will check which Node will best fit to schedule a Pod based on Hardware Configuration of a Node.

Scheduler is a component on Master that watches the newly created Pods that have no Node assigned and selects a node for them to run on.
Scheduler gets all the information from ETCD. i.e
Scheduler gets all the information of Hardware Configuration of Worker Nodes from Configuration Files i.e indirectly from ETCD data store and
schedules the Pods accordingly.

3.Control Manager :
-------------------
Control Manager is the component of the Master that runs different monitors.we have 

KUBE-CONTROLLER-MANAGER
CLOUD-CONTROLLER-MANAGER

KUBE-CONTROLLER-MANAGER :

kube-controller-manager runs some Controller's that will inform the Master about 

It will check all the Nodes are working fine and is there any Node which is failed or not Available and can take some necessary actions.
It will check the correct number of Pods are running as per specification.
It will check the Health status of the Cluster.
All these controllers are seperate process and however to reduce the complexity they are compiled into a single binary and run as a single process.

kube-controller-manager has the following Controllers :

Node Controller
Replication Controller
Endpoints Controller
Service Account and Token Controller

Node Controller is responsible for monitoring the Nodes and whenever a Node goes down it will send a signal.
Replication Controller is responsible for maintaining the correct number of Pods as per the configuration specified.
Endpoint controller is responsible for maintaining all the services and communications.
Service Accounts and token controllers are responsible for creating Accounts and API access tokens for new namespaces.

All these controllers will run some monitros in loops which will take care of the cluster and it will get the configuration of the desired infra structure.
whenever there is some mismatch or not as per the configuration it will send the signals and send the communication to required component that will take appropriate action.

CLOUD-CONTROLLER-MANAGERS :

when we use the infra structure of a cloud provider all the monitor's that needs to run for intercating with cloud service provider
or the infra structure of the cloud service provider is done through cloud control manager.

Cloud control Manager has some monitors that interacts with cloud service providers.

NodeController 
Route Controller
Service Controller
Volume Controller

Node Controller responsible for checking with the cloud provider to determine if a Node has been deleted in the Cloud after it stops responding.
Route Controller is responsible for setting up the routes in underlying cloud infrastructure.
Service Controller is responsible for creating,updating and deleting cloud provider load balancers.
Volume Controller is responsible for creating,attaching and mounting volumes and interacting with cloud providers to orchestrate volumes.

All the above Controller's are responsible for managing and maintaining the interaction with the cloud service provider.
We can disable the controller loops by setting the --cloud--provider flag to external when starting the kube controller manager.

4.ETCD :
--------
ETCD is a open source,distributed and key value data store in Kubernetes Cluster.
ETCD is consistent and highly available key value store used as Kubernetes backing store for all cluster data.
ETCD is a single source of truth for all the components of the Kubernetes Cluster.

API server is the only component that intercats with ETCD data store.
ETCD can be the part of Kubernetes Master or can be configured externally.

WORKER NODE :

Worker Nodes can be a Physical or Virtual Machine where Containers are deployed.
Every Node in Kubernetes Cluster must run a Container Runtime like Docker.

Worker Node has the following Components.

1.kubelet
2.kubeproxy
3.Container Runtime

These Components run on every Node and responsible for maintaining the Pods and providing the Kubernetes Runtime Environment.

1.kubelet :
-----------
kubelet is an agent or utility running on each Worker Node and is the component that intercats with Master using API Server.
kubelet gets the information from Pods spec and based on those specifications it makes sure that Containers are running accordingly on the Pods.
In case if there is any issue with any Pod,kubelet tries to restart the Pod on the same Node or different Node.

Note :
kubelet does not manage the Containers which are not created by Kubernetes. 

2.kube-proxy :
--------------
kube-proxy is the networking component in a Node and it can also intercat with the external world.
This is the Component or an Agent which is responsible for maintaining the Network Configuration and Rules.

All Node runs the Daemon called kube-proxy which watches the API server on the Master Node,
So that it can communicate with Master Node using API Server and it gets all the information for addition and removal of Services and Endpoints.

Note :
API Server component of the Master Node interacts with kube-proxy and kubelet Component of worker Node.

3.Container Runtime :
---------------------
Container Runtime is the software that is responsible for running the Containers.
Most common Container platfrom used in Kubernetes is Docker.

Kubernetes supports several Container Runtimes
Docker
Contained
Cri-o
Rktlet
Kubernetes CRI (Container Runtime Interface)

Kubernetes does not have the capabilty to directly handle Containers.
In order to run and manage a Container's lifecycle,Kubernetes requires a Container Runtime on the Node where a Pod and its Containers are to be scheduled.

We can also have the extended functionality of the Kubernetes like 
Dashboard
Monitoring
Logging
DNS
