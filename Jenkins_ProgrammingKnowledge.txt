*****************************   17.Jenkins Pipeline		 **************************************************************

Pipeline is a workflow with a group of events or Jobs that are chained and integrated with each other in a sequence.
To implement Jenkins Pipeline we use a file called Jenkinsfile.
We call the Jenkinsfile as Pipeline as a code.
Pipeline script is a Groovy sandbox syntax.

Jenkinsfile can be written in two ways.
1.Declarative Format
2.Scripted Format
Scripted Format is the older format and Declarative Format is the more recent way of writing Jenkinsfile.
Both the format uses Groovy and there is a difference in the structure.

General --> New Job --> GitHub Project --> Mention the GitHub Project URL in the General Tab.
In the Pipeline Tab --> Select PipelineScript --> Copy the Pipeline Script.
