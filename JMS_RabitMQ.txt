RabitMQ is a Message Broker that implements Advanced Message Queuing Protocol (AMQP).
AMQP Standardizes messaging using Producers,Brokers and Consumers.
Messaging increases loose coupling and Scalability.

	Producer --> Exchange --> Queue   -> Consumer 
	
Publishing a message means Producer Sends the Message to the Exchange and Exchange in turn forwards the Message to the Queue.
Consuming a message means consume a message from the Queue.
In a Complex Application we have multiple Queues.

When an Exchange receives a Message,it sends it to the Selected Queue.
An Exchange Connects to a Queue using a Binding or Binding Key.

To Send a Message to a Exchange producer needs to Specify the Routing Key and an Exchange Compares the Routing Key and identifies the type of Exchange.

1.Fanout Simply ignores the Routing Key and Sends out the message to the Queue all it knows about.
2.Direct Exchange Sends the Message to the Queue where the Routing Key is same as Binding Key.
3.Topic Exchange Sends the Message to the Queue where the Routing Key partially matches with the Binding Key.
4.Header Exchange uses the Message Header instead of Routing Key.
5.Direct or Nameless Exchange sends the Message to the Queue using the Queue name and not using binding Key.

Core Concepts :
---------------
Producer emmits/publishes the message to the Exchange.
Consumer receives message from Queue.
Binding connects with an exchange to a Queue using Binding key.
Exchange Compares the Routing Key with the Binding Key.
Message Distribution to the Queue depends on type of Exchange.
Types of Exchange are Fanout,Direct,Topic and Header.
Special Exchange created by RabitMQ is Default Exchange that compare the Routing Key with the Queue Name.
Default Exchange indirectly Sending the Message directly to the Queues.
