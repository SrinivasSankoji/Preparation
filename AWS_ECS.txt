1.Introduction :
----------------
Consider the case of deploying a web application on to an EC2 instance.
Here we are deploying a single Application on single instance.
What If the traffic to the application increases or an instance goes shut down.
This is why we need multiple instances running copies of an Application.
We also need a Load Balancer ie accepts the incoming trffic request and based on some conditions in the network traffic
redirect the request to one or more instances.
Here we also need Auto Scaling ie if the instance goes down,new instance has to be created.
based on the traffic instance has to be scaled up or scaled down.

If we have created multiple instances and all the instances are shut down at a time.
This is the scenario where ECS comes into the picture.
ECS automatically starts up the instances and hosts the web application into that instance.
ECS monitors the EC2 instances and scales up or scale down the number of instances.
ECS can also scale up the number of copies of applications based on traffic load,CPU and memory needs.

ECS is Container Management Service that makes it easy to run,manage and stop Docker Containers on a Cluster.
ECS is highly scalable and fast.
It is compared to Kubernetes,Docker Swarm and Azure Container Service.


ECS runs the containers on a cluster of EC2 instances pre installed with Docker.
ECS takes care of deploying the containers on cluster of EC2 instances,scale the instances,monitor and manage the instances.
Specific instance where a Conatiner runs on and maintainance of all the intances is taken care by ECS.


2.Terms and architecture :
--------------------------
Consider the scenarion of building an Application that runs on two Docker Conatiners.
Main Application and the other to mange the Metrics.
If the traffic to an Application is high we might need to run several pairs of Conatiners.
Terms included are 

Task Definition
Task
Service
Cluster
ECS Conatiner Service
ECS Conatiner Agent
