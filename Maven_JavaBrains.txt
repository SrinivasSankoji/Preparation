*********************************************************************** 1.Introduction ***********************************************************************

Maven is mostly used as a build Tool i.e helps us to build and deploy the code in development Environment.
Maven can also be used as a Project Management Tool i.e generate reports,dependency management etc.
Most common problems while developing the Application are

Project Structure
Dependency and Versions
build,publish and deploy.In case of ANT we write the targets.
Multiple Jars can also be resolved by using Maven.

Maven helps in creating the project structure,managing the dependencies and provides the information about the project etc.
Maven Helps in resolving the above activities by using maven repository.
There are Repository's online and Maven talks to them to reolve the issues.
To check whether the Maven has installed or not we use the command 

	mvn --version.

create the directory myApp -->	
To Create an Application using Maven we use the command 

	mvn archetype:generate
	
When we run the above commad Maven will download the required plugIns and will open the prompt to choose a Number.
i.e what kind of Application we want to be created by Maven
choose version 
choose group Id i.e Package structure
choose artifact Id  i.e Application Name

Here Maven has created a folder structure along with pom.xml

Note :
archetype is model that how the project want to be structured.
They are predefined archetypes available online.
default is 106.
Spring Boot : 2689

Here Maven download the dependencies i.e spring-boot-starter-test.
If the spring-boot-starter-test is dependent on another Jar then Maven takes care of its related dependencies.

*********************************************************************** 2.Setting Up ***********************************************************************

To compile the Maven Project navigate to the directory where the pom.xml is present.
	
	cd D:\Maven\springbootmaven
	
Now run the command

	mvn compile
	
Maven takes care of downloading all the dependencies that we mentioned in pom.xml and compile the .java classes of an Application.
Here Maven compiles all the classes present in the src directory.
Maven also compiles the test classes present inside the test directory.
Once the compilation is done we need to package it and we use the command

	mvn package

The above command will package the Application into jar file.
The above command will also run the Testcases.
To execute the Application 

	java -cp target/springbootmaven-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar  com.jio.ngo.simple.SampleSimpleApplication.java

Maven Repository has two types of Informations
Archetype Information
Dependency Information

*********************************************************************** 3.Understanding Archetypes and pom.xml *********************************************

The first thing Maven does for us is creating a source code template called Folder Structure. 
Second Maven does is build i.e compile the code and package the Application into a jar File.
Here We are Generating the source code structure by using the command and the output of this command is the folder structure and pom.xml 

	maven archetype: generate 
	
This was downloaded from the Maven Repository based on the given input.

archetype : 
This is the information to the Maven that what kind of project we need.
Maven comes with a huge list of archetypes and each archetype corresponds to a particular type of Application that we want to develop.
Archetypes for Spring Application,Hibernate Application etc.

Group Id and Artifact Id :
The above two identifies the output that we are generating.
If the Project generates the Jar file then we need to give the GroupId and ArtifactId for that Jar File.

Note :
we can have n number of artifactId under groupId.
ArtifactId is a name given to a Project.

Version :
versioan has default 1.0-snapshot
snapshot is useful when it is in development.
Once code is released for the Production,then we mark it as Release.

Package :
Package is the place where we place the source code.
Depending on the input provided to the package,Java Class in the Archetype will be assigned to the Package.
If it is a Web Application it is a War.
If it is a Java Application then it is a Jar.

name :
Here name can be different from ArtifactId.
If the name is different then the Application is visible with the Name but Application is built with ArtifactId.

dependency :
<dependencies> will have the list of dependencies that the project has.

scope:
It is used by Maven when we are building and packaging an Application.

Note :
We need to define the GroupId,ArtifactId and version in such a way that Other Applications can consume our ArtifactId(Application) If we save it in a Repository.
If we do not want to publish it to the Repository and want to use it for Internal Purpose. 
Maven has an Internal Repository and Whenver we build an ArtiactId then it is going to install it in the Local Repository.

If some other Application needs an ArtifactId then firstly it checks in the Local Repository and pulls from the Local Repository.
If it is not available then it searches in the Remote Repository.

In the pom.xml we have 
Maven Co-ordinates   i.e groupId,artifactId and version
Metadata  
Build Information i.e packaging
Resources and Dependencies

*********************************************************************** 4.Maven Build Phases **************************************************************

Maven chooses the standard project structure based on the archetype we select and we can also customize the archetype.This is the First phase.
Second phase is build process i.e Once we have done with the coding,we need to build and deploy the code.
Maven helps in Build process.

Build was done using some of the commands

	compile
	package

We need to specify one command that will take care of all the other activities.
In case of ANT we need to specify target for each step.
Every step has to be explicitly mentioned like validate,compile,package,deploy and install.

Maven has standrad directory structure and it knows what needs to be done.
Consider the scenario if we have created any project using maven archetype and it has 2 folders i.e main and test.
If the code is in the main then Maven assumes that it as the Application Code.
If the code is in the test then Maven assumes that it as the Test cases.
Depending on that it compiles the main source code and not the test cases.
Maven will run the test cases before we package the code.

Maven has something called as Build Life cycle and is defined as a part of Maven Architecture.
Every Build has a life cycle.
First we write the code,compile it,run the Test cases,package the Application,install it in a particular Repository or in a shared location where other developers can use the binary.
Maven has an internal Build Life cycle itself.
Build Life cycle is split into different phases.

validate  i.e cheks everything is in order
compile
test
package 
install
deploy

All these phases will form the Maven Build Life Cycle.
If we do not configure then Maven will choose the default Build Life Cycle.
If we specify the Build phase package then Maven Automatically executes the previous phases i.e compile and test.
If any of the phase Fails then next phase won't be executed.


install :
Maven installs the artifact into the local Maven Repository.
If one project depends on another project artifact then Maven searches for the artifact in the Local Repository and if it does not found then Maven Searches in the Remote Repository.
install helps in publishing the jar into the Local Repository.

deploy:
If we want to publish the artifact to the remote Repository where the other users can download.

Example :
In order to run any of the phases,navigate to the directory where the pom.xml is present



*********************************************************************** 5.Adding Dependency	 **************************************************************

Till now we have choosen the archetype for an Application and set up the project structure.
We alos peroform the Maven Build phases like compile,test,package,install and deploy.
Here we add the dependency by changing the pom.xml and Maven to import the jars from the Repository.

Note :
target folder is the result of build and compile that we did earlier.
We can clear the target folder by using the command mvn clean.
clean is a phase which removes all the classes and the jars that were generated earlier.

Example :
consider the scenario of adding the log statement instead of sysout.
Here we need to add the dependency to use the log statements in the program.
Maven does the things automatically by adding the dependency.

Note :
If we don't use Maven we need to download the jar and add it to the classpath to make it available to the program.
Then the program can be able to compile.

If the Maven does not find the dependency and we run the below command then we get the Compilation Error.

	mvn compile

Here we need to tell the Maven to pull the jar from Central Repository by adding the dependency in the pom.xml.
dependency contains the GAV i.e For Maven to identify the artifacts we need to define the 
groupId
artifactId
version

When we add the dependency,During the compile phase it will download all the jars which are required and makes them available to th classpath to compile.

Note :
Default scope is compile i.e dependencies will be available during the compilation phase.

*********************************************************************** 6.Web Application Using Maven ***********************************************************************




*********************************************************************** 7.Compiler Plug In	*********************************************************************************

PlugIns are a way in which we can extend the functionality of Maven.
Maven Architecture itself is a assembly of PlugIns and is a modular Architecture.
Maven Compiler is a PlugIn inside the Maven system.
All the core components acts as a PlugIns and make it as a Modular Architecture.
Advantage of PlugIn Architecture is that we can add PlugIns and we can configure the way we want to extend the functionality.

If we create the Web Application using Maven we get the Compiler PlugIn inside pom.xml.
Here the source and target is 1.4

	<plugins>
		<plugin>    
			<artifactId>maven-compiler-plugin</artifactId>
			<configuration>
				<source>1.4</source>
				<target>1.4</target>
			</configuration>
		</plugin>
	</plugins>

The above code is generated while we choose the archetype and is the configuration for Maven Compiler PlugIn.
In our code If we use the Generics in our code which comes in 1.5,code won't get compiled.
For Maven 2 default version is 1.4.
Here we need to specify the configuration externally for the Generics code to work i.e make the source and target to 1.5.
To check the default JDK version of Maven we use the below command which shows the Java Version in which Maven runs.

	mvn -v



*********************************************************************** 8.Jetty Plug In  ***********************************************************************************



*********************************************************************** 9.Eclipse Plug In For Maven and Maven PlugIn for Eclipse  ******************************************

Maven has a modular architecture that comprises of lot of plugIns.
Eclipse is widely used IDE nad even that has modular Architecture.
