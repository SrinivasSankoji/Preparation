1.Introduction :
----------------
Maven is mostly commonly is used as a Build Tool i.e Helps to Build the Code in Development Environment.
Maven Can also be Used for Project Management Tool i.e Generate Reports,Dependency Management etc.
Most Common Problems and Activities While Developing the Application are

Multiple Jars
Dependency and Versions
Project Structure
Build,Publish and Deploy

Maven Helps in Resolving the Above Activities by Using Maven Repository.
To check the Maven has Installed or Not Use The Command mvn --version.
To Create the Application using Maven We Use the command mvn archetype:generate and 
choose a Number i.e What Kind of Application Want to be Created by Maven
choose version 
choose group Id i.e Package structure
choose artifact Id  i.e Application Name

Here Maven has Created a Folder Structure along with pom.xml

2.Setting Up :
--------------

3.Understanding Archetypes and pom.xml :
----------------------------------------
The First Thing Maven Does for us is Creating a Source Code Template called  Folder Structure. 
Second Maven Does is Build i.e compile the Code and package the Application into a Jar File.
Here We are Generating the Source Code Structure by using the Command 	maven archetype: generate 
and the output of this is the Folder Structure and pom.xml
