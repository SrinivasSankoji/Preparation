A Transaction is nothing but a group of operations that are executed as a single unit.
Distributed Transaction Management in MicroServices refer to the transactions that involve multiple micro services each handling the part of the Transaction.
Here coordination is required to ensure Transaction's Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation and Durability.
Spring boot provides several features to manage distributed transactions in Micro service architecture.
We can use either Two phase commit or SAGA pattern to manage distributed transactions.

Two-Phase Commit — 2PC :
------------------------


Saga Pattern :
--------------
Each business Transaction which spanned across multiple Microservices are split into Microservice specific local Transactions and they are executed in a sequence to complete the business workflow.
Saga Pattern can be implemented in two ways.

Choreography :
--------------
Each service will be executed independently and Services communicate via events.
There is no central coordinator.
Once the task is completed it invokes the next task in the sequence.
In case if the next task fails it invokes the compensating tasks of the previous transactions.

Success Flow :

OrderCreated -> PaymentCompleted -> InventoryRejected -> PaymentRefunded -> Order CANCELLED

Failure Flow One :
------------------
Client places order.
OrderService creates PENDING order and emits OrderCreated.
PaymentService tries to charge but fails.
PaymentService emits PaymentFailed.
OrderService listens to PaymentFailed and cancels the order.
No inventory reservation or shipping ever happens.

Failure Flow Two :
------------------
Client places order.
OrderService creates PENDING order and emits OrderCreated.
PaymentService successfully charges and emits PaymentCompleted.
InventoryService tries to reserve stock BUT fails (out of stock).
InventoryService emits InventoryRejected.
PaymentService listens to InventoryRejected, refunds the payment, and emits PaymentRefunded.
OrderService listens to PaymentRefunded and cancels the order.
No shipment is created.

Orchestration :
---------------
Orchestration means the services are executed by another parent task.
Parent task plays the role of an Orchestrator.
Parent task calls each task in sequence and based on their response parent task decides whether to call the next task or the compensating task.

############################################## 2.Distributed Transactions (TechDummies with Narendar) ###################################################

Consider the scenario where the user wants to place an Order.

In case of Monolith Application, assume we have a single Database.
The flow will be as follows.

User reuests for an Order
In the Service Layer we start the Transaction.
To place the Order, Here two actions are reuired.
Check the user has sufficient balance.If the user has sufficient balance,it updates the balance and request should be forwarded to place the Order.
If the user doesnot have sufficient balance, Then it will throw an Exception and the Order will get cancelled.
If the user has sufficient balance and there are no enough products in the invenotry, then update balance will get rollbacked and throws an Exception.
Even if we have multiple Transactions, This particular transaction will get blocked untill it commits or throws an error.

In case of Microserices Application, assume we have a multiple Databases.
The flow will be as follows.

In case of Microservices, when the user places an Order, Orchestrator service recieves the reuest and call two different Microservices.
The services are Payment Microserice and Inventory Microservice.
The services has their own Database.

Orchestrator service will call the Payment service to check whether the user has sufficient amount to place an Order.
If the the user has sufficient amount then it will deduct the amount and updates the balance.
If the user has sufficient balance then Orchestrator service will call the Inentory service to check for the particular product in the inventory.
If the product is available in inventory then Orchestrator service will place the order.

Consider the scenario where the user has sufficient amount and product is not available in the inventory.
Since we have multiple Microservices i.e. Transaction is isolated and we cannot rollback the previous Transaction.
i.e. Amount is updated and no product in Inventory then Order will get cancelled but the amount is updated.
These are some of the problems when the Transactions are distributed.

If the Multiple Microservices are connected to a single Database then the approach to handle Transaction will be different.

The above problems can be resolved by using
1.Two phase commit
2.Three Phase commit
3.SAGA Orchestrator
4.SAGA Choreography

Two phase commit :
------------------
Here we have two phases to complete the Transaction.
Prepare and Commit.
Here we are adding one more Component named Coordinator Service which will take care of Two phase commit.
Here Commit will happen in two steps.

When the user places an Order, Coordinator service will create the Transaction Id.
This TransactionId will be used as a reference in all the Micro services.

Coordinator service will do the prepare phase i.e.
Coordinator service will call the Payment service and Inventory service to check for the amount and product in the inventory.
If the user has sufficient amount and product in the inventory, then it will block the particular row in both the Payment and Inventory Service.
So that no can perform transaction on that particular row.
Here Coordinator service waits for the response from Payment and Inventory service.
Once Coordinator service gets the response from both Payment and Inventory service then it will go the next phase i.e. Commit phase.

In the Commit phase,Coordinator service will call the Payment and Inventory service to commit based on the input given from the prepare phase.
Then Coordinator service will get the response from both the Payment and Inventory service saying that balance is updated and product is deducted from inventory.
Then the coordinator service will do the commit to complete the Transaction.

Failure scenarios :
-------------------
When the Coordinator service calls the Payment and Inventory service to check for the amount and product in the inventory, 
If there is no sufficient amount or product is not available in the inventory, then Coordinator service will throw an Exception in the prepare phase itself.

If the prepare phase is success then Coordinator service calls the Payment and Inventory service to commit the data.
But at the time of commiting if there are any issues, then Coordinator service will get the response as Not OK.
Then Coordinator serice will roll back the entire Transaction saying that Order is not placed.

Here isolation is provided because at the time of prepare phase itself both the rows in Payment and Inventory serice are locked.
So no other concurrent reuest can modify the same row which is locked and have to wait for the Transaction to be completed.
Here we also need a Timeout mechanism.
Consider the prepare phase is ready and commit phase is taking time to complete the Transaction.
Then in that case Coordinator service will wait for some time and after that it aborts the Transaction.

Advantages :
------------
Two phase commit is strong consistent model of Distributed Transaction.

Disadvantages :
---------------
1.Here the Coordinator is handling all of these Microservices.
If there is a failure in Coordinator service then the Transaction will get roll back even though the user has sufficient amount and product is available in inventory.

2.Also at the time of prepare phase we are locking the records in both Payment service and Inventory service.
If the locks are on hold for some time then it will cause latency issues.

3.What if the Node in which the Micro service is running is down.
In this case Coordinator serice will make the reuest to Micro service without knowing the state of the Service.

Also Two phase commit implementation is a tidious job.
To resole the above problems there is an adanced version called Three Phase commit.

Three phase commit :
