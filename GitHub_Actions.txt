************************************************** 1.GitHub Actions (Adam Zolyak)  *********************************************************

With GitHub Actions we can automate our workflow from an idea to Production.
Actions allows us to write scripts that are triggered based on certain events in GitHub Repoitory like 
creating a new issue,pushing the Request,merging the Pull Request etc.
An Event here is GitHub WebHook Event.

Automating things based on Events in GitHub Repoitory is not a new Idea.
For most of the Years we are using CI tools like CircleCI,Travis CI,Jenkins and others to automate things by running scripts in CI jobs.
GitHub even created probot framework to make it easier to GitHubApps to automate things.
However each of these aproach requires signing up for additional services,hosting and running scripts,monitoring,maintaining etc.
The above case will cost the money.

GitHub Actions are 100% contained to GitHub and GitHub Repoitory.
No Additional tools or services or money is required.
We can store our Actions code in GitHub Repoitory and GitHub runs the Action Code for us.

The two basic building blocks of GitHub Actions are
1.Workflow
2.Action

1.Workflow :
------------
Workflow's are triggered based on GitHub WebHook Event.
Evnet fires when certain things happens in our Repoitory like creating a new issue,commenting on pull Request,merging a Branch etc.
Workflow runs one or more Actions.

2.Action :
----------
An Action is a Docker Container that runs as a part of a Workflow.
We can store our Acions within our GitHub Repository or we can use other people Actions stored inside public GitHub Repository.
We can also use prebuilt Docker images from Docker Registry.

Both Workflow and Actions are written as code and stored as a part of our GitHub Repository and 100% Reproducible from the Code.
GitHub Actions provides a way to automate the repetitive tasks in our Workflow.


New Issue Comment - GitHub Action :
-----------------------------------
Consider the scenario of creating a basic GitHub Action that demonstrates how to post a welcome comment when new issue is created.
GitHub Action runs when an Event WebHook is fired on our GitHub Repository.
Action checks If the Event is of type action=opened and posts a comment to the issue thanking the user for their contribution.
