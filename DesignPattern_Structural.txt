####################################### 3.Composite (Salitha Chathuranga & Abdulaziz Pulatjonov) ########################################

Composition represents a group of Objects defined through a structure or hierarchy.
Composite design pattern allows us to treat individual Objects and composition of Objects in the same way.
Tree structure could be the perfect example for Composite design pattern as it inherits the base type and can be represented as a part of whole hierarchy.
Composite design pattern can be classified into 4 types.

1.Component
2.Leaf
3.Composite
4.Client

1.Component :
-------------
Component is an interface or abstract class with the methods which has to be implemented in its Child composites.
Component is considered as the parent for all the composite Objects.

2.Leaf :
--------
Leaf is an Object which implements the behavior of the Component and does not contain any references to other Objects.             

3.Composite :
-------------
Composite is an Object which implements the behavior of the Component part and contains the references to other composite objects.
Composite is similar to Leaf but the only difference is it references to other Composite or Leaf Objects.

4.Client :
----------
Client is an instance of an Object which has access to composition elements by using Component Object.

Consider the scenario of Employee and Company.

Employee is the Component.
CEO,Manager,QA,Developer are the Leaf objects which does not contain any reference to other Objects.
CompanyDirectory is a composite object which implements the Component part and contains the reference to other Composite or Leaf objects.
Contains the reference of adding or removing the Composite or Leaf objects.

CEO.java :
----------

	public class CEO implements  Employee{
    private final String name;
    private final String dept;
    private final String job;

    public CEO(String name, String dept, String job) {
        this.name = name;
        this.dept = dept;
        this.job = job;
    }

    @Override
    public void showDetails() {
        System.out.println(this);
    }

    @Override
    public String toString() {
        return "CEO{" +
                "name='" + name + '\'' +
                ", dept='" + dept + '\'' +
                ", job='" + job + '\'' +
                '}';
    }
	}

Developer.java :
----------------

	public class Developer implements Employee{
    private final String name;
    private final String dept;
    private final String job;

    public Developer(String name, String dept, String job) {
        this.name = name;
        this.dept = dept;
        this.job = job;
    }

    @Override
    public void showDetails() {
        System.out.println(this);
    }

    @Override
    public String toString() {
        return "Developer{" +
                "name='" + name + '\'' +
                ", dept='" + dept + '\'' +
                ", job='" + job + '\'' +
                '}';
    }
	}
	
CompanyDirectory.java :
-----------------------

	public class CompanyDirectory implements Employee {

    private final List<Employee> employees;

    public CompanyDirectory() {
        this.employees = new ArrayList<>();
    }

    public void addEmployee(Employee employee) {
        employees.add(employee);
    }

    public void removeEmployee(Employee employee) {
        employees.remove(employee);
    }

    @Override
    public void showDetails() {
        for (Employee employee:employees){
            employee.showDetails();
        }
    }
	}
	
Company.java :
--------------

	public class Company extends CompanyDirectory {

    private final String name;

    public Company(String name) {
        super();
        this.name = name;
    }

    public void showCompanyName() {
        System.out.println("Company: " + name);
    }
	}
	
CompositeDemo.java :
--------------------

	public class CompositeDemo {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        CEO ceo = new CEO("Nandini", "COM", "Chief Executive Officer");

        Developer developer1 = new Developer("Srinivas", "ENG", "Project manager");
        Developer developer2 = new Developer("XYZ", "ENG", "Associate Software Engineer");

        CompanyDirectory softwareCompany=new CompanyDirectory();
        softwareCompany.addEmployee(ceo);
        softwareCompany.addEmployee(developer1);
        softwareCompany.addEmployee(developer2);

        Company company = new Company("N Technologies");
        company.addEmployee(softwareCompany);
        company.showCompanyName();
        company.showDetails();
		}
	}
	

################################################### 4.Decorator (Salitha Chathuranga & java67) ##########################################

https://salithachathuranga94.medium.com/decorator-design-pattern-in-java-1b0931ead0e4

Decorator Design pattern is a structural design pattern that allows us to add a new functionality to an existing Object without changing its structure.
Decorator Design pattern allows us to do runtime modifications of an Object.
The traditional way of adding new functionality to an existing Object is by using inheritance i.e. at compile time.
Decorator Design Pattern uses Composition which makes it more flexible to add new functionality at runtime.
Because of this flexibility Decorator Design Pattern is one of the darling pattern for many Java Developers.


########################################### 5.Facade (Abdulaziz Pulatjonov & Prabhu Kumar) ##############################################

https://blog.devops.dev/structural-design-patterns-in-java-facade-design-pattern-a6d2797ed8de


Facade Design Pattern is one of the subtype of structural design pattern.
Facade Design Pattern provides a unified interface to a set of interfaces in the Complex sub system.
Facade Design Pattern provides a high level interface that makes the subsystem easier to use.
Facade Design Pattern provides a simplified interface that the Client can be used to access the System.
Here business logic can be hidden behind the interface so that Client does not aware of implementation.

Facade Design Pattern is appropriate when we have a Complex System and want in a simplified way.
The classes and Objects participating in this pattern are 

Subsystem classes
Subsystem classes forms the complex interface of the existing sub system.
Facade
Facade provides simplified interface which delegates calls the to the Classes in the Sub System.
Client
Client invokes Facade which shields away complex interface from the Client.

########################################### 6.Flyweight (Rajeshvelmani & Abdulaziz Pulatjonov) ###########################################

Flyweight Design Pattern is one of the subtype of of the Structural Design Pattern.
Flyweight Design Pattern suggests minimize the creation of new Objects each time by resusing existing ones.
Flyweight Design Pattern is particularly useful when dealing with large number of similar Objects by improoving performance and reducing memory footprint.
Flyweight Design Pattern optimizes the memory usage by sharing common data between multiple Objects.
Instead of each Object holding its own data,seperates the intrinsic state (shared) and extrinsic state (unique) of an Object.

In Flyweight Design Pattern HashMap is used to store the references to the Object that has been created and and associate them with a unique key.
So whenever new Object is needed,Client just passes the unique property and is checked in HashMap.
If an Object with that unique property already exists then reference to that Object will be returned otherwise new Object is created.

Key features of Flyweight Design Pattern are 

Flyweight Interface :
---------------------
This interface defines the methods that the Flyweight Object must implement.
This interface contains the operations that can be shared and executed by multiple Objects.

Flyweight Factory :
------------------
Flyweight Factory creates and manages Flyweight Objects.
Flyweight Factory ensures that Flyweight Objects are shared and reused across multipe Clients.

Concrete Flyweight :
--------------------
Concrete Flyweight Class represents the shared Flyweight Object.
It stores the intrinsic state and provides an implementation for shared operations.
