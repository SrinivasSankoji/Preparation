***************************************************** 1.VPC Basics  ***************************************************

Consider the case we have a Network in an Organization i.e. private Network.
We have systems that are connected to the LAN and the routing between the System happens using Switch.
Switch works at the lower level protocol called ARP(Address Resolution Protocol).
Now the Systems within the LAN can communicate with each other using MAC Addresses.

We might have other systems that are connected to different LANs. 
To connect a system in one LAN to a system in another LAN, using just a switch is not sufficient because switches operate within a single LAN. 
To enable communication between systems on different LANs, a device called a router is needed.

A router can connect to multiple switches and operates at the network layer, using the IP (Internet Protocol) to route data between the LANs. 
It understands IP addresses and facilitates communication between systems on different networks.
Finally, routers can also manage inbound and outbound connections to the Internet, allowing systems within a LAN to communicate with external networks.

If we want the same Network in cloud we use AWS VPC.
AWS VPC enables us to launch the AWS services into a virtual network that we have defined.
This virtual network closely resembles to the Traditional Data Center with the benefits of using scalable infrastructure of AWS.

Once we have an AWS Account we can use any of the available regions.
Every region has one or more VPC's.By default Amazon restricts the count to 5 but we can increase.

We have multiple AWS services and each service has different scope.
Some services works at Global Level i.e. Billing, IAM, Route53 etc.They have the effect on all the regions.
There are some services which operate at regional level i.e. S3, CDN, DynamoDB etc.
Similarly there are some services which works at availability zone level i.e. EC2, RDS etc.
Every region has two or more availability zones.
When we launch an EC2 instance either we create in AZ1 or AZ2.
Availability zones are the physical Data Centers.
Scope of these services are limited to Availability Zones.
Load Balancers can span across Availability Zones and can send the traffic across multiple Availability Zones.

Consider the scenario where we have created a VPC in one region.
VPC is private address space similar to Company's private Network.
In that Network we have many Host's i.e. Machines.
Machines would have IpAddress.

VPC is a big Address space and we can divide this address space into smaller address space which is called Subnet.
Subnet and Availability Zones have one-to-one mapping.

Every VPC has a Route Table which takes the routing decission.
How the traffic flows in and out of VPC.

In any VPC we have two levels of firewall.
Firewall which works at an instance Level i.e. Security Group.
Firewall which works at Subnet Level i.e. Network Access Control List(NACL).

Internet Gateway allows the Instance in VPC to connect to the Internet.
Internet Gateway allows the user to make the Subnet public by providing a route to the Internet.
If we want to connect to any Instance in VPC from the outside world we use Internet Gateway.
Consider the scenario where we have launched a Web Application in an EC2 instance defined in VPC.
If we want to access that Application we have to make it publcly available ie attach the VPC to the Internet Gateway.

If we want on premise Data Center to be connected to Amazon Network we use Virtual Private Gateway.
Suppose If we want the VPC to be secured ie don't want to put the Internet Gateway.
Still we want to use the Application hosted inside the VPC over a private IPAddress.
In this case we need a virtual private Gateway at Amazon Side that provides the VPN concentrator using which we can connect the VPC from Data Center.

VPC Addressing :
----------------
Whenver we create a VPC we need to provide the Address Range ie private Address space Range in the CIDR notation.
CIDR stands for classless InterDomain Routing.
IPv4 Addresses are 32 bit ie
	
	8  8  8  8

Here Any IPAddress would be of range between 0 to 255.
IN CIDR notation we represent the IPAddress in the form of 

	X.X.X.X/P
	
Here P stands for prefix.
Example : 10.200.0.0/16
Here 16 bits are for the Network and remaining is for the Host.
Then the Addresses would be

	10.200.0.0
	10.200.0.1
	
	10.200.0.255
	
	10.200.1.0
	10.200.1.1
	
	10.200.1.255
	
If we create the Network with this CIDR notation we can have 2 power 16 ie 65536 IPAddress in the Host.
We have to divide these Address space into smaller Network Address space ie Subnet.
Whenever we create a Subnet we need to decide the size of the Subnet.
Consider the case where every Subnet size is of 255.

	10.100.0.0
	
	10.100.255.255
	
First Subnet Address starts from
	
	10.100.0.0
	10.100.0.255
	
Seocnd Subnet starts from 

	10.100.1.0
	10.100.1.255
	
To create the Subnet with size 256 then the CIDR notation would be

	10.100.0.0/24(32-8)
	
Similarly To create the Subnet with size 16(Least Size) then the CIDR notation would be

	10.100.0.0/28 (32-4)
	
***************************************************** 2.Public and Private Subnet  *****************************************************

To connect to the EC2 Instance from Windows --> login as ubuntu.
To check whether we are able to connect an instance in private subnet from an instance in public subnet,we ping the ipAddress of the private EC2 Instance.

	ping 10.100.1.0
	
To login to private EC2 instance from public EC2 instance
--> create the pem file by copying the pem file of private subnet i.e. 

	vi awstraining-ec2-private-key.pem
	
--> Add the permissions to the pem file ie 

	chmod 400 awstraining-ec2-private-key.pem
	
Then runn the command

	ssh -i awstraining-ec2-private-key.pem ubuntu@IPAddress
	
***************************************************** 3.NAT Gateway   *****************************************************************

If we want to access the Internet in the private Subnet we need to have a Network Address Translation(NAT) Gateway.
Here we cannot dircetly access the Internet from the private Subnet.
Create the NAT Gateway in the public Subnet because because NAT needs communication with an Internet.
Instances which are in the public Subnet can communicate with Internet(Internet Gateway).
NAT also requires public IPAddress or Elastic IPAddress.
Add the NAT Gateway in the Route Table of the Private Subnet so that Internet access will be enabled.

Note :
------
we need to delete the NAT Gateway as it is Billable.
We also need to delete the NAT Gateway entry in the Private Subnet Route Table.

***************************************************** 5.VPC Peering  ******************************************************************

Create the VPC Peering between the private Subnet of VPC A and private Subnet of VPC B. 
Configure the Route Tables of the private Subnet's in both VPC A and VPC B with VPC Peering.
Also modify the Security Group of Private Subnet of VPC B to get the Access of Private Subnet of VPC A.
