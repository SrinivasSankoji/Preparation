************************************************* 1.Introduction to Spring MVC Test Framework  *************************************************

What is Spring MVC Test Framework :
-----------------------------------
Spring MVC Test is a Testing Framework which provides support for testing Spring MVC Controllers.
We can write the Test cases by using Junit4,Junit5 or TestNG.
We can also use other Testing Frameworks which provides support for Spring MVC Test Framework or we can use stand alone configuration.
Since Spring MVC Test framework is built on top of Servlet API mock objects provided by the spring-test module,it does not require Servlet Container.
Spring MVC Test Framework internally uses the DispatcherServlet that provides full support for Spring MVC runtime behavior.
We can configure the System under Test either by using Stand alone Configuration or Web Application context based Configuration.

Key Components of Spring MVC Test Framework :
---------------------------------------------
MockMvc class acts as an Entry point for our Unit and Integration Tests.
To be more specific we will use this class whenever we want to send the HTTP request to the system under Test.

MockMvcBuilders class provides static factory methods that can be used to create new MockMvc Objects.

MockMvcRequestBuilders class provides static factory methods that can be used for creating the HTTPRequest to be sent to the System under Test.

MockMvcResultMatchers class provides static factory methods that can be used to write assertions for the returned HTTPResponse.

MockMvcResultHandlers class provides static factory method that can be used 
whenever we want to print the returned HTTP response to a log file by using apache commons Logging Library.
