****************************************************** 3.Server-Sent Events in Spring  ******************************************************

Server Sent Events i.e SSE is an HTTP Standard that allows a Web Application to Handle UniDirectional Event Stream and 
receive Updates when ever Server Emmit Data.

SSE is a Specification adopted by Most Browsers to allow Streaming Events in UniDirectional at Any Time.
These events are Just a Stream of UTF-8 Encoded Text Data that Follow the Format Defined by The Specification.
The Format Consists of a Series of key Value Elements Like Id,Name and Event.

SSE Specification Does NotRestrict the PayLoad Format and Can Use a Simple String,Complex JSON or XML Structure.
The Main Difference Between Web Socket and SSE is Web Socket Offers a Full Duplex Communication Between the Server and Client Where as
SSE Provides UniDirectional Communication i.e Server to Client.
