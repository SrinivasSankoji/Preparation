########################################################### 1.Deep Dive Into the Retry Pattern (Smita Kothari) ###########################################################

Retry mechanism helps systems automatically recover from transient failures like network glitches, momentary unavailability or service throttling
by trying the operation again after a short delay.

The Retry pattern is a fault-handling mechanism where a failed operation is retried automatically based on a defined strategy.
1.Number of retry attempts
2.Delay between retries (fixed, exponential, random)
3.Conditions for retry (specific exceptions)

Usage :
-------
1.API temporarily overloaded
2.Database momentarily locked
3.Service just rebooted
4.DNS resolution failed briefly

Instead of failing the entire operation, Retry may succeed on the second or third attempt.

Retry only when it is likely to succeed on the next attempt like
1.Network blips which cause SocketTimeoutException, ConnectException, UnknownHostException (sometimes), IOException
2.HTTP status codes with 429 / 503 / 502 / 504
3.Optimistic locking / DeadlockLoserDataAccessException (DB deadlocks)

Whenever we are using Retry, make sure the operations are Idempotent.
Retries without Idempotent are data corruption with good intentions.

Retry alone is dangerous :
--------------------------
If downstream is down then retries multiply traffic.
Leads to retry storms.
Consumes threads.
Amplifies outages.

Circuit Breaker alone is insufficient :
---------------------------------------
It doesn’t recover transient failures.
Users may see unnecessary errors.

		| Failure type     | Retry      | Circuit Breaker  |
		| ---------------- | ---------- | ---------------  |
		| Temporary glitch | ✅ recover | ❌ not needed    |
		| Sustained outage | ❌ harmful | ✅ protects      |
		| Slow degradation | ⚠️ limited | ✅ isolates      |

Exponential Backoff :
---------------------
Exponential backoff is a retry delay strategy where the wait time between retries increases exponentially after each failure, Instead of retrying immediately or at a fixed interval.
Exponential backoff is a foundational resilience technique used in
Microservices
Distributed systems
Cloud SDKs
Message brokers
API clients

If the retries happen instantly
Retry storms
Thundering herd effect
Downstream overload
Cascading failures
Thread exhaustion

Exponential backoff solves this by spacing retries progressively.
BaseDelay = 200ms
Multiplier = 2

	| Attempt | Delay  |
	| ------- | ------ |
	| 1       | 200ms  |
	| 2       | 400ms  |
	| 3       | 800ms  |
	| 4       | 1600ms |
	| 5       | 3200ms |
	
| Call |----200ms----| Call |----400ms----| Call |----800ms----| Call |

Here Retry pressure decreases over time.
