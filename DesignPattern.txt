################################################### 1.Service Locator Design Pattern (Java Techie) ###################################################

Service Locator is a design pattern used in SDLC to encapsulate the process involved in obtaining a service with strong abstraction Layer.
The goal of this module is to improvve the modularity of an Application by removing the dependencies between the client and implementation of an interface.
Service Locator acts as a Central registry that provides implementations of different interfaces.
Spring Framework internally uses Service Locator Design Pattern to manage Dependency Injection.
