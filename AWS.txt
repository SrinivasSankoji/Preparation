*************************************************************************  1.AWS Introduction (thedevcoach) ***************************************************************

AWS stands for Amazon Web Services.
AWS has a wide range of computing products taht allows us to operate tasks on the cloud on demand.
Currently AWS is the biggest service offering of the cloud market that has databases,event queues to basic web site hosting.

AWS is designed to be quite low level and it is not designed for casual web site builder.
AWS is built for large enterprises to build their entire business on.
AWS is not only low level but there are many different services and lots of services that even substitute each other.

WHERE TO START LEARNING AWS :
-----------------------------
While learning AWS we should focus on 3 Areas.

1.AWS Core Services
2.Hands on Learning on AWS Core Services.
3.Structure the Learning 

Within AWS many services are built on set of core services.
AWS has a service called ECS(Elastic Container Service) that allows us to run container based services.
When we run the services on ECS,we need to configure the host for our containers to run on.
One of the option to run the host is EC2.
In this scenario EC2 is the core service.
Many services in AWS are periphery services which are compliment and build on others.

Core Services in AWS are EC2,IAM and S3.

EC2 :
-----
EC2 is way of running the computer in the cloud.
In EC2 we can launch Linux Machine,Windows Machine etc.
EC2 is like having a Computer at the Push of a Button.
EC2 is popular because of its flexibiity.
On EC2 we can run different type of workloads.We can install wordpress to build a web site.
We also can install database and store data directly on EC2.
Imagine we can run everything on EC2.

Since EC2 is more flexible we don't run everything on EC2.
If we run the database on EC2 we also need to manage ourself.
AWS offers RDS which takes away of maintaining our own database.
But AWS runs it under the hood of EC2.

we not only run machines on the cloud i.e EC2,we also need other features such as permissions.
IAM comes into the picture.

IAM :
-----
IAM is how we manage parmissions and access in AWS.
In order to launch EC2 we need to have a user that has the appropriate access to do so.
To get access we need to use AWS IAM.
IAM is not only how users get access to do things in AWS but also how we grant machines to talk to each other.

For instance EC2 machine can be assigned a role.
That role then governs what an EC2 machine can and cannot do.
We need to understand the different IAM objects and their relationships.
Within IAM we have users,roles,groups and policies and all these are related somehow.

A User can be in the Group and that Group can have access policies which are granted to the User.
Also User can have policies directly.

S3 :
----
S3 allows us to store files in a flexible way.
S3 can be used to host websites,stores assets such as images and even log files for an application.
If we ever need simple persistence for files S3 is the best answer.

If we want to use AWS RedShift i.e querying tool we need to put data in S3.
If we want to get access logs in AWS account then data will be in S3.
If we want to host static website,turn on logs for load balancer we need S3.

Other Core Services are 

CloudWatch : Built in AWS Monitoring Tool.
Route 53   : Domain Purchasing and DNS Routing.Allows us to point our website or server to a domain Name.
RDS 	   : AWS hosted database solutions.Has a range of databases from SQL to document based.
CloudFormation : AWS built in infrastructure as code.create resources by writing our infrastructure as a JSON Template and tell AWs to create it.


2.Hands on Learning on AWS Core Services :
------------------------------------------
In order to get hands on we need to make ensure that everything in AWS account is set up properly.

Root Account : why we should not use it.
Access keys  : why should be very careful and where we store them.
MFA          : how it protects our account from getting hacked
Infrastructure as Code : how it makes our hands on learning easier.
