Cloud Computing is a term referred to storing and accessing the data over the Internet.
Here it does not store any data on the hard disk of a computer.
In Cloud computing we can access the data from the Remote Server.

AWS stands for Amazon Web Services.
AWS has a wide range of computing products that allows us to operate the tasks on the cloud.
Computing products like Storage,Database,Analytics,Networking,Mobile,Development Tools,Enterprise Applications etc.
AWS is designed to be quite low level and is not designed for casual web site builder.
AWS is built for large enterprises to build their entire business.
AWS is not only low level but there are many different services and lot of services that even substitute with each other.

WHERE TO START LEARNING AWS :
-----------------------------
While learning AWS we should focus on 3 Areas.

1.AWS Core services
2.Hands on learning on AWS Core services.
3.Structure the learning 

Core Services in AWS are EC2,IAM and S3.

EC2 (Elastic Cloud Compute) :
-----------------------------
EC2 is a service from Amazon that provides resizable computing capacity in the cloud.
Resizable because we can quickly scale up or scale down the number of instances as per our computing requirements.

EC2 is way of running the computer in the cloud.
In EC2 we can launch Linux Machine,Windows Machine etc.
EC2 is like having a Computer at the push of a button.

In EC2 we can run different type of workloads.
We can install wordpress to build a web site.
We also can install database and store the data directly on EC2.
Imagine we can run everything on EC2.

Note :
------
Since EC2 is more flexible we don't run everything on EC2.
If we run the database on EC2 we need to manage ourself.
AWS offers RDS which takes care of maintaining our own database.

we not only run machines on the cloud i.e. EC2 we also need other features such as permissions.
IAM comes into the picture.

IAM :
-----
IAM stands for Identity and Access Management which allows the user to define their access and their level of Access.
In order to launch EC2 we need to have a user that has the appropriate access to do so.
To get access we need to use AWS IAM.

IAM is not only how the users get the access to do things in AWS but also how we grant machines to talk to each other.
For instance EC2 machine can be assigned a role.
That role then governs what an EC2 machine can and cannot do.

We need to understand the different IAM objects and their relationships.
Within IAM we have users,roles,groups and policies and all these are related somehow.
A User can be in the Group and that Group can have access policies which are granted to the User.
Also User can have policies directly.

S3 :
----
S3 allows us to store files in a flexible way.
S3 can be used to host static websites,stores assets such as images and log files of an application.
If we need a simple persistence for files then S3 is the best answer.

If we want to use AWS RedShift i.e querying tool we need to put data in S3.
If we want to get access logs in AWS account then data will be in S3.

Other Core Services are 

RDS 	   : AWS hosted database solutions.Has a range of databases from SQL to document based.
Route 53   : Domain Purchasing and DNS Routing.Allows us to point our website or server to a domain Name.
CloudFormation : AWS built in infrastructure as code.creates resources by writing our infrastructure as a JSON Template and tell AWs to create it.
CloudWatch : Built in AWS Monitoring Tool.

2.Hands on Learning on AWS Core Services :
------------------------------------------
In order to get hands on we need to make ensure that everything in AWS account is set up properly.

Root Account : why we should not use it.
Access keys  : why should be very careful and where we store them.
MFA          : how it protects our account from getting hacked
Infrastructure as Code : how it makes our hands on learning easier.

******************************************************************** 2.AWS Introduction (Guru99)  ****************************************************************

EC2: 
EC2 is a way of running the Computer on the Cloud on which we have OS Level Control.We can run this Cloud Server whereever we want.

LightSail : 
It is a Cloud Computing tool that automatically manages the storage,computer and networking capabilities that are required to run the Application.

Elastic Beanstalk :
It offers automated deployment and provisioning of resources like a highly scalable production website.

EKS(Elastic Container Service For Kubernetes) :
It allows us to work on Kubernetes on Amazon Cloud Environment without installation.

AWS Lambda :
It is a service that allows us to run functions in the cloud.It is a big cost save because it allows us to pay only when the function got executed.


********************************************************************* 5.AWS Introduction (Online Tutorials) ***********************************************************

Whenever we get a new project from any Organization we need to understand the requirement and how long will it take to develop the Application.

					Application
					Runtimes
					Security and Integration
					Databases
					Servers
					Virtualization
					Server Hardware(CPU,RAM)
					Storage Devices
					Networking Devices

Once the Application is finalized we need to get 

How much Storage devices are required.
How much Server Hardware is required.
Networking Devices required to connect the Server Hardware

we need to connect all the three i.e Storage device,Server hardware and Network devices.
Finally we need a Network Admin who will create a Virtualization Layer on top of these Hardwares.
Virtualization helps in providing different kind of systems on the same server.
Here we can have both Linux Machine as well as Windows Machine on the Same Server.
Once the Virtualization is completed Architect comes into the picture and he will create a Server based on his requirement on the virtual machine.
Architect will also design the database.
Once the Server and Database are designed by the Architect,Developer will start implementing the Application and run those Applications.
Security Engineer will ensure all of them are tightly integrated and secured from any Attacks.
This is how the traditional IT Company works till now.

Once the Cloud came into the picture,solution is divided into 3 parts.
1.Infrastructure as a Service
2.Platform as a Service
3.Software as a Service

In case of Infrastructure as Service we do not worry about setting up the 
Networking Components 
Storage Components 
Server Hardware
Virtualization etc.
Here we are asking the Cloud vendor to provide the Linux Server with some configuration.
It is best suitable for the Solution Architects that helps in saving the cost.

In case of Software as a Service we directly use the Application.
Example are GoogleDrive,Gmail,Apps on Android etc.
It is best suitable for the End Users.

In case of Platform as a Service we only need to implement the Application.
If we want to implement a Java Application we need a Linux Server with Java installed on it.
It is best suitable for the Application Developers.

Difference between Traditional Infrastructure and AWS Services :
----------------------------------------------------------------
Whenever we are going to get any project,Company purchases lot of Servers,Racks and storage devices like DAS,SAN,NAS,RDBMS etc.
All of these are interconnected using Router,Pipelines,switches etc.by the Administrator.
Administrator is going to provide the Firewall and security for the complete Infrastructure.

Compared to On Premise Servers we also have Servers in the AWS Cloud.
AWS has a ready image i.e AMI(AMazon Machine Image) for Windows OS,Linux OS etc.
Pick up the ready image and start the EC2 instance (Elastic Compute Cloud).EC2 is also called as virtual machine.

In Traditional Networking Architecture we have Routers,Pipelines,Switches that connects with the Servers,Storage Devices and Databases etc.
In Case of AWS we have Load Balancers that directly connects to the Virtual Servers and it balances the complete Load.
How much traffic can flow to each virtual server is decided by Load Balancer.

We can also create our own VPC(Virtual Private Cloud) in which we can connect all the devices i.e servers,databases etc.
We can also create our own Security Groups,NACL's(Networl Access Control List).
Whatever Network we are going to build we are going to secure with Security Groups and NACL's.

In case of Traditional Architeture we have Network Administrators who are going to provide priviliges.
In case of AWS we have to use IAM Services to provide the Access rights.

For the traditional Sequential Databases we have AWS RDS Service.
For Storage of File system like images,static Files etc we have AWS S3(Simple Storage Service).
To spin up the OS,Store,install and run the Software we have AWS EBS(Elastic Block Store).

We have Elastic File System that automatically grows and shrinks.He are we are going to pay for the data that we are using.

Advantages of AWS Cloud Computing :
-----------------------------------
Stop guessing about capacity.
Increase in speed and agility.
Stop spending money on running and maintaining Data Center.
Go Global in Minutes.
Trade Capital expense for variable expense.
Benefits from Massive economies of sale.

AWS Platform :
--------------
AWS Global Infrastructure
Networking

Compute 
Storage
Database
Security and Identity

AWS Global Infrastructue is about 2 things i.e Regions and Availablity Zones.
Region is nothing but Geographic Location and it consists of atleast 2 Availablity Zones.
Availablity Zone is nothing but cluster of Data Centers and is isolted from failures in other Availablity Zones.
All the Availablity Zones are inter connected with each other.

In case of Networking,
How to set up our own private Cloud
How to Host websites usiing Route 53
How we can get a Direct Connect with AWS Cloud Platform by bypassing the Internet.

In Case of Compute,
EC2 i.e Virtual Machine

In Case of Storage we have
S3
EFS
Cloud Front
Glacier
Storage Gateway

In Case of Databases we have
RDS
RedShift
DynamoDB
ElasticCache
DMS (Database Migration Service)

Public Cloud :
Here Infrastructure is provided by the Cloud Vendor.

Private Cloud :
For a long time we have been into the private Cloud Model.
Here Organizations built their own data centers inside the Building.

Hybrid Cloud :
It is combination of both private cloud and public cloud.
