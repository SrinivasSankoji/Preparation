*************************************************************************  1.AWS Introduction (thedevcoach) ***************************************************************

AWS stands for Amazon Web Services.
AWS has a wide range of computing products that allows us to operate tasks on the cloud on demand.
AWS is designed to be quite low level and it is not designed for casual web site builder.
AWS is built for large enterprises to build their entire business on.
AWS is not only low level but there are many different services and lots of services that even substitute with each other.
Currently AWS is the biggest service offering of the cloud market that has databases,event queues to basic web site hosting.

WHERE TO START LEARNING AWS :
-----------------------------
While learning AWS we should focus on 3 Areas.

1.AWS Core Services
2.Hands on Learning on AWS Core Services.
3.Structure the Learning 

Within AWS many services are built on set of core services.
AWS has a service called ECS(Elastic Container Service) that allows us to run container based services.
When we run the services on ECS,we need to configure the host for our containers to run on.
One of the option to run the host is EC2.In this scenario EC2 is the core service.
Many services in AWS are periphery services which are compliment and build on others.

Core Services in AWS are EC2,IAM and S3.

EC2 (Elastic Cloud Compute) :
-----------------------------
EC2 is way of running the computer in the cloud.
In EC2 we can launch Linux Machine,Windows Machine etc.
EC2 is like having a Computer at the push of a Button.

EC2 is more popular because of its flexibiity.
On EC2 we can run different type of workloads.
We can install wordpress to build a web site.We also can install database and store data directly on EC2.
Imagine we can run everything on EC2.

Since EC2 is more flexible we don't run everything on EC2.
If we run the database on EC2 we also need to manage ourself.
AWS offers RDS which takes away of maintaining our own database.
Here AWS run it under the hood of EC2.

we not only run machines on the cloud i.e EC2,we also need other features such as permissions.
IAM comes into the picture.

IAM :
-----
IAM is how we manage parmissions and access in AWS.
In order to launch EC2 we need to have a user that has the appropriate access to do so.
To get access we need to use AWS IAM.
IAM is not only how users get access to do things in AWS but also how we grant machines to talk to each other.

For instance EC2 machine can be assigned a role.
That role then governs what an EC2 machine can and cannot do.
We need to understand the different IAM objects and their relationships.
Within IAM we have users,roles,groups and policies and all these are related somehow.

A User can be in the Group and that Group can have access policies which are granted to the User.
Also User can have policies directly.

S3 :
----
S3 allows us to store files in a flexible way.
S3 can be used to host static websites,stores assets such as images and log files for an application.
If we ever need simple persistence for files S3 is the best answer.

If we want to use AWS RedShift i.e querying tool we need to put data in S3.
If we want to get access logs in AWS account then data will be in S3.
If we want to host static website,logs for load balancer we need S3.

Other Core Services are 

CloudWatch : Built in AWS Monitoring Tool.
Route 53   : Domain Purchasing and DNS Routing.Allows us to point our website or server to a domain Name.
RDS 	   : AWS hosted database solutions.Has a range of databases from SQL to document based.
CloudFormation : AWS built in infrastructure as code.create resources by writing our infrastructure as a JSON Template and tell AWs to create it.


2.Hands on Learning on AWS Core Services :
------------------------------------------
In order to get hands on we need to make ensure that everything in AWS account is set up properly.

Root Account : why we should not use it.
Access keys  : why should be very careful and where we store them.
MFA          : how it protects our account from getting hacked
Infrastructure as Code : how it makes our hands on learning easier.

Root Account :

******************************************************************** 2.AWS Introduction (Guru99)  ****************************************************************

Cloud Computing is a term referred to storing and accessing the data over the Internet.
Here it does not store any data on the hard disk of a computer.
In Cloud computing we can access the data from the Remote Server.

AWS is a platform that offers Reliable,Scalable,Flexible,Easy to use and cost effective cloud computing solutions.
The Platform is developed with a combination of Infrastructure as a Service,Platform as a Service and Software as a Service.
AWS has a wide range of cloud computing Products that includes Storage,Database,Analytics,Networking,Mobile,Development Tools,Enterprise Applications etc.
All these srevices are used as pay as you go pricing Model.


EC2: 
It is a Virtual Machine in the Cloud on which we have OS Level Control.We can run this Cloud Server whereever we want.
LightSail : 
It is a Cloud Computing tool that automatically manages the storage,computer and networking capabilities that are required to run the Application.
Elastic Beanstalk :
It offers automated deployment and provisioning of resources like a highly scalable production website.
EKS(Elastic Container Service For Kubernetes) :
It allows us to work on Kubernetes on Amazon Cloud Environment without installation.
AWS Lambda :
It is a service that allows us to run functions in the cloud.It is a big cost save because it allows us to pay only when the function got executed.



********************************************************************* 5.AWS Introduction (Online Tutorials) ***********************************************************

Whenever we get a new project from any Organization,
we need to understand the requirement,How long it will take to develop the specific Application and requirements to implement the Application.


					Application
					Runtimes
					Security and Integration
					Databases
					Servers
					Virtualization
					Server Hardware
					Storage
					Networking

Once the Application is finalized we need to get 

How much Storage devices are required
How much Server Hardware is required 
Networking devices required to connect the Server Hardware

we need to connect all the three i.e Storage,Server and Network Devices.
Finally we need a Network Admin who will create a Virtualization Layer on top of these Hardwares.
Virtualization helps in providing different kind of systems on the same server.
Here we can have both Linux Machine as well as Windows Machine on the Same Server.
Once the Virtualization is completed Architect comes into the picture and he will create a Server based on his requirement on the virtual machine.
Architect will also design the database.
Once the Server and Database are designed by the Architect,Developer will start implementing the Application and run those Applications.
Security Engineer will ensure all of them are tightly integrated and secured from any Attacks.
This is how the traditional IT Company works till now.

Once the Cloud came into the picture,solution is divided into 3 parts.

Infrastructure as a Service
Platform as a Service
Software as a Service

In case of Infrastructure as Service we do not worry about setting up the 
Hardware Components,
Networking Components 
Storage Components 
Virtualization etc.
Here we are asking the Cloud vendor to provide the Linux Server with some configuration.
It is best suitable for the Solution Architects that helps in saving the cost.

In case of Software as a Service we directly use the Application.
Example are GoogleDrive,Gmail,Apps on Android etc.
It is best suitable for the End Users.

In case of Platform as a Service we only need to implement the Application.
If we want to implement a Java Application we need a Linux Server with Java installed on it.
It is best suitable for the Application Developers.

Difference between Traditional Infrastructure and AWS Services :
----------------------------------------------------------------
Whenever we are going to get any project,Company purchases lot of Servers,Racks and storage devices like DAS,SAN,NAS,RDBMS etc.
All of these are interconnected using Router,Pipelines,switches etc.by the Administrator.
Administrator is going to provide the Firewall and security for the complete Infrastructure.

Compared to On Premise Servers we also have Servers in the AWS Cloud.
AWS has a ready image i.e AMI(AMazon Machine Image) for Windows OS,Linux OS etc.
Pick up the ready image and start the EC2 instance (Elastic Compute Cloud).EC2 is also called as virtual machine.


In Traditional Networking Architecture we have Routers,Pipelines,Switches that connects with the Servers,Storage Devices and Databases etc.
In Case of AWS we have Load Balancers that directly connects to the Virtual Servers and it balances the complete Load.
How much traffic can flow to each virtual server is decided by Load Balancer.

We can also create our own VPC(Virtual Private Cloud) in which we can connect all the devices i.e servers,databases etc.
We can also create our own Security Groups,NACL's(Networl Access Control List).
Whatever Network we are going to build we are going to secure with Security Groups and NACL's.

In case of Traditional Architeture we have Network Administrators who are going to provide priviliges.
In case of AWS we have to use IAM Services to provide the Access rights.

For the traditional Sequential Databases we have AWS RDS Service.
For Storage of File system like images,static Files etc we have AWS S3(Simple Storage Service).
To spin up the OS,Store,install and run the Software we have AWS EBS(Elastic Block Store).

We have Elastic File System that automatically grows and shrinks.He are we are going to pay for the data that we are using.

Advantages of AWS Cloud Computing :
-----------------------------------
Trade Capital expense for variable expense.
Benefits from Massive economies of sale.
Stop guessing about capacity.
Increase speed and agility.
Stop spending money on running and maintaining Data Center.
Go Global in Minutes.

AWS Platform :
--------------
AWS Global Infrastructure
Networking

Compute 
Storage
Database
Security and Identity

AWS Global Infrastructue is about 2 things i.e Regions and Availablity Zones.
Region is nothing but Geographic Location and it consists of atleast 2 Availablity Zones.
Availablity Zone is nothing but cluster of Data Centers and is isolted from failures in other Availablity Zones.
All the Availablity Zones are inter connected with each other.

In case of Networking,
How to set up our own private Cloud
How to Host websites usiing Route 53
How we can get a Direct Connect with AWS Cloud Platform by bypassing the Internet.

In Case of Compute,
EC2 i.e Virtual Machine

In Case of Storage we have
S3
EFS
Cloud Front
Glacier
Storage Gateway

In Case of Databases we have
RDS
RedShift
DynamoDB
ElasticCache
DMS (Database Migration Service)

Public Cloud :
Here Infrastructure is provided by the Cloud Vendor.

Private Cloud :
For a long time we have been into the private Cloud Model.
Here Organizations built their own data centers inside the Building.
Application Built here is used only within the Organization.

Hybrid Cloud :
It is combination of both private Cloud and Public Cloud.
