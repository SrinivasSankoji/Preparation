1.why we need EBS :
-------------------
EC2 Machine looses its root volume(Main Drive) when it is manually terminated.Unexpected terminations might happen from time to time.
Sometimes we need a way to store our instance data somewhere.
AWS EBS is a persistent block level storage volume that can be attached to an EC2 instances.
Just like Computer needs a Hard drive, EC2 needs a Storage volume to store the OS which we have specified during the instance creation.
EBS allows the user to create and manage persistent block level storage volumes, similar to hard disks which can be attached to EC2 instances as virtual hard disks.
EBS Volumes are highly available and can provide durable storage for various applications and workloads.

2.What is mean by persistent storage :
--------------------------------------
Persistent storage is a data Storage device that retains the data even if the associated EC2 instance is stopped or terminated.
Persistent Storage is also known as non-volatile storage device.
Hard Disk and SSD(Solid State Drive) are common type of Persistent Storage.
Once the Persistent Storage is attached we can create the File System on top of these volumes, run the Database etc.

EBS are Availablity Zone specific and automatically replicated with its Availablity Zone to protect from Component Failure, Offering a high Availablity and durability.
With EBS we can scale our usage up or down within Minutes.

3.Few Points for EBS Volume :
-----------------------------
EBS is a network drive and not a physical drive.
EBS uses the network to communicate with the instance so there might be a bit of latency.
EBS can be detached from one instance and attached to another one quickly.
EBS are specific to Availablity Zone.
EBS Volume in One zone cannot be attached to another Zone.
To move a Volume across we need a Snapshot.
We get the EBS capacity of 10GB and IOPS.
We can increase the capacity of the drive at any time.

4.Types of EBS :
----------------
1.General Purpose SSD
2.Provisioned IOPS SSD
3.Throughput Optimized HDD
4.Cold HDD

General Purpose SSD :
---------------------
This is the default volume that EC2 chooses by default as a root volume for the instance.
It provides the balance of performance and cost effective.

SSD i.e. Solid State Drive which is multiple times faster than HDD(Hard Disk Drive) for small input and output operations.
Having SSD as the root volume for an instance can significantly increase the perfromance of the server.

Here performance is measured in terms of IOPS.
How many input and output operations our server can handle per second.
EBS volume provides a ratio of 3 IOPS per GB with the ability to burst upto 3000 IOPS for a fixed period of time.

Note :
IOPS refers to the operations on blocks that are upto 256 KB in size. 

Usecase :
Most workloads such as Virtual Desktop,Dev and Test Environments and low latency interactive Apps.

Provisioned IOPS SSD :
----------------------
This is the fastest and most expensive EBS volume.
Designed for intensive applications such as large Relational Databases and No SQL Databases.

Usecase :
Mission critical Applications,large database workloads such as MongoDB etc.

Throughput Optimized HDD :
--------------------------
These are low cost magnetic storage volumes which defines performance in terms of throughput.
Designed for large sequential workloads like BigData, Data Ware Houses, Log Processing etc.
Mostly we use this volume for Hadoop cluster.

Cold HDD :
----------
These are even cheaper than low cost magentic storage volume.
Designed for storage of large File Server.

Magnetic Storage :
These are previous generation magnetic drives that are suitable for workloads where the data is accessed infrequently.

5.EBS Snapshots :
-----------------
Snapshot is simply and AMI.
Snapshot can be used as a backup of a volume and stored in S3 so automatically we get the high durability.
We can use these snapshots to create a new EBS Volume and attach to the newly created instance.
Snapshot can only be accessed form EC2 dashboard.
We can copy Snapshot across Availablity Zone or Region. 
We can also make an image from Snapshot.
Snapshot can be automated using Amazon Data Life Cycle Manager.

Note :
It is recomended to detach volume to do Snapshot.
Should not run the snapshot while the Application is handling a lot of traffic.

Some Facts about EBS :
----------------------
1.EBS Volume can only be mounted to a Single EC2 instance at a time.
If we want to assign a volume to Multiple Instances we use Elastic File System.
2.Volumes other than root Volumes can be encrypted.
3.By default root volumes are deleted on termination of instances.
4.We can copy snapshots between AWS regions to create volumes in different regions.
5.Size of an EBS Volume can be upto 16 TB.

6.EBS Migration :
-----------------
EBS Volumes are specific to Availablity Zone.
To migrate it to different Availablity Zone 

Snapshot the Volume and make sure that volume is detached before snapshot.
Copy the Volume to different Region.
Create the Volume from the Snapshot in the required Availablity Zone.

7.EBS Encryption :
------------------


8.Encryption: encrypt an unencrypted EBS volume :
-------------------------------------------------


9.EBS vs Instance Store :

############################################################# 8.Use Cases for EBS (Aakib) #######################################################

Key Features of EBS :

1.Durability
2.Elasticity
3.Performance
4.Snapshots

1.Durability :
--------------
EBS volumes are designed for durability i.e. Data stored in EBS volumes is highly resistant for failures.
AWS replicates the data within the same availability zone to ensure redundancy and reliability.

2.Elasticity :
--------------
EBS volumes can be easily created, resized and attached to an EC2 instance as per the application requirement.
This allows the flexibility and scalability, ensuring our storage needs can met as the workload grows.

3.Performance :
---------------
EBS volumes offer different volume types.
Each volume type is optimized for specific usecases. 

4.Snapshots :
-------------
EBS allows us to take snapshot of the volumes, creating backups that can be used for data recovery or to create new volumes.
These snapshots are stored in Amazon S3 and offer an effective way to protect the data.


The different usecases for EBS are :

1.Database storage
2.Web server storage
3.Data analytics
4.Disaster recovery


1.Database storage :
--------------------
EBS volumes provide durable and high performance storage for Databases like MySQL, PostgreSQL or Oracle

2.Web server storage :
----------------------
EC2 instances hosting Web Application can leverage EBS volumes for storing static and dynamic content.

3.Data analytics :
------------------
EBS is suitable for Data analytics workloads providing the necessary storage and the capacity for processing large datasets.

4.Disaster recovery :
---------------------
EBS Snapshots allows us to create back up of volumes, enabling efficient disaster recovery solutions.


############################################################# 9.Create and Modify EBS (Rahul wagh) ##############################################

Create a VPC with two availability zones.
Create and EC2 instance
Create an EBS Volume
Attachan EBS volume to an EBS intance.

Once we create an EC2 instance connect to an EC2 instance and check the default volume in the EC2 instance.

	ssh -i "aws-login.pem" ubuntu@ec2-13-233-162-173.ap-south-1.compute.amazonaws.com
	sudo lsblk
	
It will show only one option with disk which has 8GB capacity.
Under EC2 instance --> Elastic Block store --> Volume --> select Create Volume with the default options.

Now attach an EBS Volume to an EC2 instance.
Select the EBS Volume --> select attach Volume --> Select the instance and attach the Volume.
Now if we run the same command again it will show the disk volume of 100 GB.

To list the disk partition of an EC2 instance
	
	sudo fdisk l
	
Copy the path of the Disk partition which we have created i.e. /dev/xvdk
We need to verify is there any file system for that the EBS volume using the command

	sudo file -s /dev/xvdk.
	
If this command is giving the output as data, then there is no file system.
We need to create the File system for the newly created EBS volume.

	sudo mkfs -t xfs /dev/xvdk
	
Once the File system is created we need to mount the File system to the particular directory.
	
	sudo mkdir /ebs-volume
	sudo mount /dev/xvdk /ebs-volume
	
To view the newly created directory

	ls -lart /ebs-volume
	
To verify the volume is mounted to the newly created directory

	df -h
	
Then create two new files in the newly created directory.

	cd /ebs-volume
	
Create the snapshot from the EC2 instance.
Select the newly created volume --> Actions --> Create Snapshot.
Once the snapshot is created, create the volume from the snapshot.

	select the snapshot --> create the volume from the snapshot.
