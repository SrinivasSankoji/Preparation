1.why we need EBS :
-------------------
EC2 Machine looses its root Volume(Main Drive) when it is manually terminated.Unexpected terminations might happen from time to time.
Sometimes we need a way to store our instance data somewhere.
AWS EBS is a persistent block level storage volume that can be used along with EC2 instances in the Cloud.
Just like Computer needs a Hard drive,EC2 needs a Storage Volume to store the OS which we have specified during the instance creation.

2.What is mean by persistent storage :
--------------------------------------
Persistent Storage is a data Storage device that retains the data even power to that device is shut off.
Persistent Storage is also known as non volatile storage device.
Hard Disk and SSD(Solid State Drive) are common type of Persistent Storage.
Once the Persistent Storage is attached we can create the File System on top of these Volumes,run the Database etc.

EBS are Availablity Zone specific and automatically replicated with its Availablity Zone to protect from Component Failure,
Offering a high Availablity and durability.
With EBS we can scale our usage up or down within Minutes.

3.Few Points for EBS Volume :
-----------------------------
EBS is a network drive  and not a physical drive.
EBS uses the network to communicate with the instance so there might be a bit of latency.
EBS can be detached from one instance and attached to another one quickly.
EBS are specific to Availablity Zone.
EBS Volume in One zone cannot be attached to another Zone.
To move a Volume across we need a Snapshot.
We get the EBS capacity of 10GB and IOPS.
We can increase the capacity of the drive at any time.

4.Types of EBS :
----------------


5.General Purpose SSD :
-----------------------
This is the default Volume that EC2 chooses by default as a Root Volume for the instance.
It provides the balance of performance and cost effective.

SSD stands for Solid State Drive which is multiple times faster than HDD(Hard Disk Drive) for small input and Output Operations.
Having SSD as the Root Volume for an instance can significantly increase the perfromance of the Server.

Here performance is measured in terms of IOPS.
How many input and output Operations our Server can handle per second.
EBS Volume provides a ratio of 3 IOPS per GB with the ability to burst upto 3000 IOPS for a fixed period of time.

Note :
IOPS refers to the Operations on blocks that are upto 256 KB in size. 

Usecase :
Most workloads such as Virtual Desktop,Dev and Test Environments and low latency interactive Apps.

6.Provisioned IOPS SSD :
------------------------
This is the fastest and most expensive EBS volume.
Designed foe intensive Applications such as large Relational Databases and No SQL Databases.

Usecase :
Mission critical Applications,large database workloads such as MongoDB etc.

7.Throughput Optimized HDD :
----------------------------
These are low cost magnetic storage volumes which defines performance in terms of throughput.
Designed for large sequential workloads like BigData,Data Ware Houses ,Log Processing etc.
Mostly we use this Volume for Hadoop Cluster.

8.Cold HDD :
------------ 
These are even cheapre than low cost magentic storage volume.
Designed for storage of large File Server.

Magnetic Storage :
These are previous generation magnetic drives that are suitable for workloads where the data is accessed infrequently.

9.EBS Snapshots :
-----------------
Snapshot is simply and AMI.
Snapshot can be used as a backup of a Volume and stored in S3 so automatically we get the high durability.
We can use these snapshots to create a new EBS Volume and attach to the newly created instance.
Snapshot can only be accessed form EC2 dashboard.
We can copy Snapshot across Availablity Zone or Region. 
We can also make an image from Snapshot.
Snapshot can be automated using Amazon Data Life Cycle Manager.

Note :
It is recomended to detach Volume to do Snapshot.
Should not run the Snapshot while the Application is handling a lot of traffic.

Some Facts about EBS :
----------------------
1.EBS Volume can only be mounted to a Single EC2 instance at a time.
If we want to assign a volume to Multiple Instances we use Elastic File System.
2.Volumes other than root Volumes can be encrypted.
3.By default root volumes are deleted on termination of instances.
4.We can copy snapshots between AWS regios to create volumes in different regions.
5.Size of an EBS Volume can be upto 16 TB.

10.EBS Migration :
------------------
EBS Volumes are specific to Availablity Zone.
To migrate it to different Availablity Zone 

Snapshot the Volume and make sure that volume is detached before snapshot.
Copy the Volume to different Region.
Create the Volume from the Snapshot in the required Availablity Zone.

11.EBS Encryption :
-------------------


12.Encryption: encrypt an unencrypted EBS volume :
--------------------------------------------------
