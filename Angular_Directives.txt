################################################### 1.What is Directives(procademy) ###################################################

We have learnt Components are the basic building blocks of Angular Application.
We also learned how Angular apps are executed and how data can communicate between Components and the View Template using Data Binding.
Directives are the another building block of Angular Application.

Directives are simply an instruction to the DOM.
We use Directives to tell the DOM what needs to be added to the Web Page and what not to be added to the Web Page.
We also instruct DOM using Directives on how to display the HTML Element.
We are actually using Directives without knowing it.
Components are one such kind of instructions to the DOM.
Using Components we instruct DOM what needs to be added to the Web Page.

Once we place the Selector of the Component some where inside the Template.
At this point we are instructing Angular to add the Content of Components View Template and the business logic of the Type Script code where we have used the Component Selector.
Indeed Components are Directives with the Template.

There are also other Directives without Template.
We can have a custom directive that can be used to change the background color of a web page to green.

	<div changeDivGreen>This is a Div</div>
	
Typically we add an attributes to the directive selector.
We can also use directives as a CSS class or like an HTML Element.
Mostly we use directives as an HTML Element.

Directive is also a Type Script class decorated with @Directive decorator.
Angular alos provides some built in Directives like ngFor,ngIF,ngStyle,ngClass etc.

Directives can be classified into two types
Structural Directive
Attribute Directive

Structural Directive manipulates the DOM by adding or removing the Elements.
Attribute Directive is used like an attribute on a existing Web Page element and is used to change its look and behavior of that particular HTML Element.
