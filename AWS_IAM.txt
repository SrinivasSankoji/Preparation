IAM is a part of Security.
Consider the scenario we have created an Account for AWS in a Company and have to do the complete Set up.
First thing we are going to look into is IAM.
This is the place we are going to add the Users and who will have the access to my AWS Account and which user have what Level of Access.
IAM stands for Identity and Access Management which allows the user to define their access and their level of Access.

Advantages of IAM :
-------------------
1.Centralized control of AWS Account.
2.Shared Access for AWS Account (Multiple Administrators)
3.Granular Permissions (Until what level user can have the specific Access.We can also defind the specific documnet)
4.Identity Federation
If the company got more than 1000 users it is difficult to add each user in IAM section.
Here we can integrate with the Active Dircetory so that all the  users can use the userId and password of the company itself.
We can also do the Identity Federation with Facebook and LinkedIn.
5. MultiFactor Authentication (Two Level Authentication)
6.Provide Temporary Accss for users/devices and services wherever necessary
As a Company we might get the requirent that we can hire some third party Engineer to resolve the issue.
Here he willget the Temporary access until the work is done.
7.Allows us to set up our own password rotation policy.
Password should be case sensitive,Atleast contain one Capital Letter etc.
8.Intergrates with many different AWS Services 
9.Supports PCI DSS Compliance

Terms in IAM :
--------------
Users
Groups
Roles
Policies

Users : End user who is going to access the AWS Cloud console.
Groups : Collection of users under one set of permissions.
Roles : We can create Roles and assign them to AWS Resources.
Gropus can be assigned to the users where as Roles can be assigned to the services.
Policies : It is a document that defines one or more permissions.
what kind of permission that a specific User will have,Group will have,Role will have.
Policies i.e permission document can be attached to User,Group,Role.

Consider the scenario where in EC2 we will launch virtual servers and in S3 is a Storage.
If EC2 wants to communicate with S3 in a secured way,provide the Role to EC2.
