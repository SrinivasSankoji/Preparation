**************************************************** 1.AWS VPC (Vishal Padghan)   *********************************************************

Security becomes more important when some resources needs to be shared with contract employees or third party vendors
because we run the risk of exposing sensitive Data to them.
Using AWS VPC we will be creating an isolated space on AWS and provide the access to those Users.
AWS VPC as the name defines It is a private cloud in the AWS Environment that helps us to use all the services by AWS in a defined private space.
We can also have the control over the virtual network and we can also restrict the incoming traffic using security groups.

There are two types of VPC
Default VPC i.e created by Amazon
Non Default VPC that is created by us to meet the securty needs.

Basic Concepts in VPC :

1.Subnet and its Utility
2.Route Table
3.Internet Gateway
4.Creating VPC using AWS Console
5.Creating A Non-Default VPC And Creating A Private And Public Subnet Inside The VPC 

1.Subnet and its Utility :
--------------------------
Subnet can be thought of dividing large network into smaller networks.
This is done because maintenance of smaller networks is easier as compared to larger networks.
It also provides the security to the network from other networks.

Example :
Consider the scenario of Teams in an Organization.
There are different Teams in an Organization like HR,Finance,Support,Operations etc.
The Data accessible to the Finance Team cannot be given to the Operations Team etc.
Here we will create a Subnet such that accessing and maintaining the Network becomes Easier.

2.Route Table :
---------------
Route Table contains set of rules called routes which determines where the traffic has to be redirected.
Route Table can also be used to add the Internet Gateway to the Subnet.
We can also have multiple route tables in a VPC.

3.Internet Gateway :
--------------------
Internet Gateway allows the user to make the Subnet public by providing a Route to the Internet.
With the help of Internet Gateway an Instance can be accessed through the Internet and resources outside the instance can access the instance.
Only one Internet Gateway can be attached to a VPC at a time.

4.Creating VPC using AWS Console :
----------------------------------


5.Creating A Non-Default VPC And Creating A Private And Public Subnet Inside The VPC :
