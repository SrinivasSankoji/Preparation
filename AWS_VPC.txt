**************************************************** 1.AWS VPC (Vishal Padghan)   *********************************************************

Security becomes more important when some resources needs to be shared with contract employees or third party vendors
because we run the risk of exposing sensitive data to them.
VPC is a private cloud in the AWS Environment that helps us to use all the services by AWS in a defined private space.
We can also have control over the virtual network and we can restrict the incoming traffic using security groups.

There are two types of VPC
Default VPC i.e created by Amazon
Non Default VPC that is created by us to meet the securty needs.

Basic Concepts in VPC :

1.Subnet and its Utility
2.Route Table
3.Internet Gateway
4.Creating VPC using AWS Console
5.Creating A Non-Default VPC And Creating A Private And Public Subnet Inside The VPC 

1.Subnet and its Utility :
--------------------------
Subnet can be thought of dividing large network into smaller networks.
This is done because maintenance of smaller networks is easier as compared to larger networks.
It also provides the security to the network from other networks.

Example :
Consider the scenario of different Teams in an Organization.
There are different Teams in an Organization like HR,Finance,Support,Operations etc.
The data accessible to the Finance Team cannot be given to the Operations Team etc.
Here we will create a Subnet such that accessing and maintaining the Network becomes easier.

2.Route Table :
---------------
Route Table contains set of rules called routes which determines where the traffic has to be redirected.
Route Table can also be used to add the Internet Gateway to the Subnet.
There can be Multiple Route Tables in a VPC.

3.Internet Gateway :
--------------------
Internet Gateway allows the Instance to connect to the Internet ie
Internet Gateway allows the user to make the Subnet public by providing a Route to the Internet.
With the help of Internet Gateway an Instance can be accessed through the Internet and resources outside the Instance can access the Instance.
Only one Internet Gateway can be attached to a VPC at a time.

4.Creating VPC using AWS Console :

5.Creating A Non-Default VPC And Creating A Private And Public Subnet Inside The VPC :

****************************************************  2.AWS VPC (Mathew Kenny Thomas) **************************************************************
AWS VPC enables us to launch AWS Resources into a virtual network that we have defined.
This virtual Network closely resembles to a Traditional Network that we would operate in our own Data Center.

Network Address Translation(NAT) :
----------------------------------
Since the Subnet is private,the IPAddress assigned to the Instance cannot be used in public.
NAT maps the private IPAddress to the public IPAddress and vice versa.
Elastic IpAddress is a static and public IPv4 Address designed for dynamic cloud computing.
We can associate an Elastic IPAddress with any Instance or Network Interface for any VPC in our Account.
With an Elastic IPAddress,we can mask the failure of an Instance by rapidly remapping the address to another Instance in our VPC.

Security Groups :
-----------------
Security Group acts as a Firewall to control Inbound and Outbound Traffic.
Each Security Group has rules according to which traffic is governed.
In Amazon Firewall the only action that can be carried out is allow.
We cannot create a rule to deny.
The Destination is always the Instance on which the Service Security Group is running.

Customer Gateway :
------------------
Customer Gateway is the resource that is installed on the Client Side and is often linked to the provider side.
Amazon VPC VPN links our Data Center to our Amazon VPC.

Virtual Private Gateway :
-------------------------
Virtual Private Gateway is the VPN Concentrator on the Amazon side.
We can create a Virtual Private Gateway and attach it to the VPC from which we can create the VPN Connection.

VPN :
-----
VPN stands for "Virtual Pair Networking" which is the popular Internet Security Method which was originally designed for large organizations where
Employee needs to connect to a certain computer from different location.
