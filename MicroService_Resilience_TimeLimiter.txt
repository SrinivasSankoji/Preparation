########################################################### 1.Fail-Safe with Resilience4j Timeout Handling (Hui) ##########################################################

Timeout is one of the key mechanisms for ensuring system stability and reliability especially when external dependencies and service calls are involved.
Properly configured Timeout mechanisms can significantly enhance system robustness and prevent a single component’s failure from bringing down the entire system.

TimeLimiter module is designed to decorate asynchronous executions.specifically
1.CompletionStage
2.CompletableFuture
3.Futures executed via ExecutorService

This is because TimeLimiter works by
Starting a timer
Waiting for async completion
Triggering TimeoutException If the result isn’t available within the configured duration.

	@TimeLimiter(name = "shippingRateApi")
	public CompletableFuture<Response> method() { ... }
	
Spring’s Resilience4j AOP expects the method to return CompletableFuture or CompletionStage
Because the aspect needs a future handle to
Apply timeout
Cancel execution
Trigger fallback

If we return synchronous type there is no async boundary to enforce a timeout.

Most of the common Application Scenarios are
1.External API Calls
2.Database Queries
3.Remote Service Calls
4.Batch Processing Tasks
5.Real-Time Data Processing
6.User Request Control

Advantages :
------------
1.Avoids long waits for responses from external services that could block the main thread.
2.Ensures that the application can continue providing other functionalities even if certain external services are unavailable.
3.Prevent excessive requests from consuming too many system resources, which could degrade overall performance.

########################################################### 2.TimeLimiter (Nithidol Vacharotayan) ########################################################################

Resilience4j has the TimeLimiter module which helps in preventing the system slowdown by setting time limits on method executions.
If a method takes longer than the configured time limit, system will throw a TimeoutExceptionhandler preventing excessive delays from cascading through the system.

Advantages :
------------
1.Prevents slow responses: TimeLimiter ensures that requests are completed within the expected time or fail fast allowing the system to recover.
2.Avoids resource exhaustion: Slow API response can lead to resource exhaustion if multiple threads wait indefinitely.
3.Enhances system stability: We can avoid failures propagating across dependent services by limiting response times.
