########################################################### 1.Redis Overview ################################################################

Redis is a key-value store Database.
Redis is distributed i.e. we can have multiple instances of Redis as part of its setup.
Here the key-value will be inserted among mutiple instances.
Redis is an in-Memory database i.e. each key-value pair will be stored insdie the memory of each instance.
Because of in-Memory feature, Redis is highly efficient and the reads are very fast.
Not required to read the data from the disk because of in-Memory.
This is the reason Redis is used as a Caching Framework.
As the Redis is the key-value store database, Within the value, it can store different types of data.
Some of the data structures for the values are 

Strings
List
Set
SortedSet
Hashes
Hyperlogs

Redis also supports Streams as values which can be considered as Redis Streams.

########################################################### 2.Redis Data types ################################################################

String Data types :
-------------------

To store the key value pair, we use the command
	
	set USER SRINIVAS
	
To get the value

	get USER
	
To store the Integer value 

	set counter 10
	
To increment the counter

	incr counter
	
T decrement the counter

	decr counter

If we want to increase the counter by some other number

	incrby counter 5
	
If we want to decrease the counter by some other number

	decrby counter 5
	
Common commands for al Data types :
-----------------------------------
To check whether the particular key exists in the Redis store or not.
If the key exists return the value 1 else 0

	exists counter
	
To delete the particular key from the Redis store

	del USER
	
If we want to make the key to be expired after the time duration.
If the key is present

	expire counter 10
	
To get the TTL for the particualr key.
If the TTL is present then returns the time in mili seconds else returns -1

	ttl counter
	
Lists :
-------
List is nothing but ordered collections of items.
To create the List in Redis

	rpush list srinivas

Here it will internally create an array at push the item to the right of the List.

	lpush list sankoji

Here it will append the item to the left of the List.
To retrieve the elements from the List

	lrange employee 0 -1
	
We can use the List in the same way as Stack.
We can pop the first element or last eement from the List

	lpop employee
	rpop employee

After popping the elements, those elements will be removed from the List.
To check the length of the List

	llen employee
	
Automatc creation or deletion of List :
Wheneverwe are pushing any element to the List, It wil check the element exists or not.
If it is the first element, then Redis creates the List automatically.
Similary, If we remove the last element of the List, the List wil be deeted automatically.

Hashes :
--------
Hashes is kind of Map.
Here for the particular key we are storing the values.

	hset employee:36 name srinivas
	hset employee:36 address uppal
	
To retreive the key value pair

	hget employee:36 name
	hget employee:36 address
	
To get the complete map details

	hgetall employee:36
	
We also have the command to the multiple values

	hmset employee:36 name sankoji address rampally
	
Set :
-----
Set stores the unique collection of un-ordered items i.e. there is no gaurantee of order.
Consider the scenario where the elements are a,b,a,c and a then set contains a,band c.

	sadd alphabets a
	sadd alphabets b
	sadd alphabets a
	
To get the elements of the Set

	smembers alphabets
	
To check for the particular element in the Set

	sismember alphabets b

SortedSet :
-----------
SortedSet stores the unique collection of ordered items.
To add the eement into the SortedSet we need to add the score along with the element.
Based on the score Redis will decide on which position the element has to be placed.

	zadd numbers 1000 one
	zadd numbers 1000 two
	
To get the elementsof the SortedSet

	zrange numbers 0 -1

To get all the elements of the SortedSet along with the scores

	zrange numbers 0 -1 withscores
	
Hyperlog Logs :
---------------
This is a special kind of data type which is applicable in certain scenarios.
Consider the scenario where we want to get the uinque elements in the collection.

	{a,b,c,d,a,a,b,b,c}
	
Here the unique element is 4 i.e. a,b,c,d
This is also known as cardinality of Set.

	pfadd loggedInUser Srinivas chary sankoji
	pfadd loggedInUser Bhaumik chary sankoji
	pfadd loggedInUser Aadvik chary sankoji
	
To get the unique counter

	pfcount loggedInUser // 5
