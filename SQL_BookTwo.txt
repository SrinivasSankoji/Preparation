************************************************* 1.MultiRow Functions (Vijay) *************************************************

Source : https://www.w3resource.com/sql/sql-table.php

https://www.databasestar.com/sql-group-by/

select * from Agents;
select * from customer;
select * from Orders;

These functions will process the group of records and returns the single value from the group.
Multirow fucntions are alos called as Group functions or Aggregate functions.
Single row functions are also called as scalar functions.

Max
Min
Sum
Avg
Count

Max :
-----
Max() returns Max value of a given Expression.
Max() is applied to Single column in a Table ie Max() accepts Single Argument and returns Single value from the group of values.

	--select  max(ord_amount) from Orders;  // 4500
	
Note:
All the Aggregate function takes only one argument.

Greatest() and Max() both returns the greatest values.
From the group of records who has taken the Maximum value,we use Max().
From the group of records who has taken the maximum value columnwise we use greatest().

	--select  greatest(ord_amount) from Orders;
	
	o/p :			
	1000
	4000
	1000
	2000
	3000
	4500

Greatest() takes multiple arguments from the group of records and retrieves multiple values in a single column.


Min() :
-------
Min() returns minimum value of a given Expression.

	--select  min(ord_amount) from Orders;
	
Note:
-----
Max and Min cannot be applied to String and Dates.
	
Sum() :
-------
Returns the total value of a given Record based on Columnwise.

	--select  SUM(ord_amount) from Orders;
	
Avg() :
-------
Returns the Average value of a given record based on column wise.

	--select  Avg(ord_amount) from Orders;
	
Count() :
---------
Retunrns the Number of values present in a Columns

	--select  Count(ord_amount) from Orders;
	
Count() function ignores null values and considers only not null values.

Note :
------
Aggregate Functions returns only summarized data where as Aggregate Functions with Analytical Functions returns Summarized Data and Detailed Data.
If Aggregate Function is used as Analytical Function then select Statement returns detailed data along with summarized data.

************************************************************ 2.GroupBy ****************************************************************************

GroupBy clause is used to group the records based on one or more columns to calculate the Aggregate values like Max(),Min(),Avg(),Sum() etc.
Aggregate Functions without Group By returns a Single value from the Group of Records ie 

	--select  max(ord_amount) from Orders;
	
If we want to find the Aggregate value for each value of X we can group by X to find it.
The select statement would be

	select colimns 
	from Table
	Where Condition
	Group By Columns
	Having Condition
	Order By Columns

//select * from sample_group_table;

If we want to find the maximum score for each subject

	--select subject_id,max(student_grade) from sample_group_table group by subject_id order by subject_id desc;
	
We can also use more than one column in group by clause.
consider the scenario where we want to sum of all the student grades for all years

	--select student_id,school_year,sum(student_grade) from sample_group_table group by student_id,school_year order by student_id;
	
To find the number of employees in each department

	--select department_id,count(*)  from employee group by department_id;
	
Note :
------
In Group By clause only GroupBy Column and Aggregate Function should appear.
If any column is present other than this we get error in sql statement.

************************************************************ 3.Joins (Vijay & databasestar) ***********************************************************

Using Mormalization we store the data into multiple Tables.
For retrieval purpose we need to gather the data from all the Tables.For this purpose we use Joins.
Join is a data retrieval operation and this operation is performed to get the data from multiple Tables.

Types of Joins :
----------------
Inner Join
Non EquiJoin
Self Join 
Left Outer Join
Right Outer Join
Full Outer Join
Natural Join
Cross Join

EquiJoin or Inner Join :
------------------------
Joining the Two Tables based on common column is called EquiJoin.
To perform EquiJoin there must be common Columns in both the Tables and we use = operator.
Name of the common Column need not be same and Primary key and Foreign Key realtionship is not mandatory.
 
	--select e.full_name,e.job_role,d.department_name from employee e join department d on e.department_id=d.department_id;
	
Non EquiJoin :
--------------
If two Tables are given to us we have to decide whether to perform EquiJoin or NonEquiJoin.
If Two Tables are joined not based on common column ie other than = operator then it is called Non EquiJoin.

Self Join :
-----------
Joining a Table to itself is called Self Join.
Self Join is not really an explicit Joinn Type.It is a way of implementing one of the Join Types.
Self Join is nothing but an EquiJoin within the same Table.
To perform Self Join the Table must be listed twice.

	--select e.employee_id,e.full_name,e.department_id,m.full_name as "Manager" from employee e join employee m  on e.manager_id=m.manager_id;
	
Outer Join :
------------
Join is used to relate the data.
While performing EquiJoin we get only matching records and If I want to get the unmatched records we perform Outer Join.
Outer Join is of three Types 

Left Outer Join
Right Outer Join
Full Outer Join

Left Outer Join :
-----------------
Left Outer Join returns the matching records and unmatching records from the Left Table and only matching records from the Right Table.

Right Outer Join :
------------------
Right Outer Join returns the matching and unmatching records from the Right Table and only matching records from the Left Table.

Full Outer Join :
-----------------
Returns all the records ie matching and unmatching records from both the Tables.
But the Rule is applicable to perfrom only one Join.
If the natch is found then it displays the matching records If not displays null values.

Natural Join :
--------------
Natural Join is similar to EquiJoin.
Natural Join can be perfromed only If common column name is same.
We can't use where clause in a Natural Join and If we do we get an Error.

	--SELECT employee_id, full_name, job_role, department_id, department_name FROM employee NATURAL JOIN department;
	
Cross Join :
------------
If we don't mention the Join in Oracle then Oracle by default performs Cross Join.
Whenever there is a requirement to combine each record of Table 1 to echa record record of Table 2.

***********************************************************  6.Sub Queries  ***********************************************************************************
A Query embeeded in another Query is called SubQuery.
There are two types of Queries.
Inner Query / Sub Query/Child Query
Outer Query / Main Query / Parent Query

The result of Inner Query is an Input to Outer Query.
Inner Query is executed First and then Outer Query is executed.
Outer Query can be create,select,update,delete where as Inner Query must be only select.
Here we have to use an operator that must return Single value.

We use Sub Queries when Where clause is based on unknown Condition.

Types of Sub Queries :
Single Row Sub Query
Multi Row Sub Query
Nested Query
Multi Column Query
Correlated Query

Single Row Sub Query :
----------------------
If the Inner Query returns only one value then Outer query also returns only one value.
If the Sub Query returns only one value then it is said to be Single Row SubQuery.

//Query to get Employee records whose Job is Clerk

--select * from Employee where job='CLERK';

//Query to get Employee records whos Job is Job of Smith and earning more than Smith

-- Select * from Employee where job=(select Job from Employee ename='Smith' and sal >(select sal from Employee where ename='Smith'));

// Query to get Name of Employee earning Maximum Salary

	select ename from employee where sal=(select max(sal) from Employee);

// Query to get the Name of the Employee having Max Experience

-- select ename from Employee where hiredate=(select min(hiredate) from Employee);

// Query to Disply the Last record in an Employee

-- Select * from employee where rowid=(select max(rowid) from Employee);

// Query to Display all the Records except Last Record

	select * from Employee where rowid<(select max(rowid) from Employee);

Sub Query with between Operator :
