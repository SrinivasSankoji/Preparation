1.Angular Architecture :
************************
Angular is Open Source Java Script Framework to build Front End Web Applications.

Architecture of Angular is Mainly Divided into three Parts :
1.Modules
2.Components
3.Services

1.Modules :
-----------
Angular Follows Modular Approach i.e Application in Angular is defined by Modules.
Every Angular Application has at least one ngModule i.e appModule and all other Modules are nested inside app Module.
ngModule is the basic Module that enables bootStrpping.
ngModule Maintains the group of Components,Services and all other Modules.
A Module can import or Export functionality from other Modules.
A small Application can have only one Module where for large Application may have Feature Modules.

To Create a Module we use the Command : ng g module occdaily

NgModule MetaData :
-------------------
The ngModule takes a Single Meta Data and has the Following Properties.

declarations[] :
----------------
All the Components,directives and Pipes that belongs to Particular Module are included in the Declarations Array.

exports[] :
-----------
Component of another ngModule has to be used in the current ngModule, then it has to be declared in the exports[].

imports[] :
-----------
If other Modules has to be used in the Current Module,it has to be declared in the import Statement.
Example Browser Module,Forms Module

providers[] :
-------------
All the Services Related to Particular Module has to be declared in the Providers[]

bootstrap[] :
-------------
The Component which has to be bootstrapped when the Application Starts has to be declared in the bootstrap[].
