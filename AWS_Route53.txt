DNS(Domain Name System) can be used to convert Domain Name like http://medium.com into an IPAddress such as http://10.100.1.0.
DNS is a collection of rules and records which helps clients in resolving domain names to IP addresses, enabling them to reach a server.
We have two type of IPAddress i.e. (32 Bit) and IPv6(128 Bit).

AWS Route53 is highly available and scalable cloud based Domain Name System.
Since the DNS operates on port 53 so Amazon decided to call it as Route53.
Route53 is a Global Service.
We need to buy a domain in order to work with Route53.

Route 53 can be used to provide public or private domain names that can be resolved by an instances within a VPC. 
Route 53 also offers features such as DNS-based Load Balancing, Health Checks, and various Routing Policies.

In Route53 we have many type of Records
1.SOA Record
2.NS Record
3.A Record
4.CNAME Record
5.Alias Record
6.AAAA Record
7.MX Record

1.SOA Record :
--------------


2.NS Record :
-------------


3.A Record :
------------
A Record stands for Address Record.
This Record is used by the computer to translate the name of the Domain into an IPAddress.

4.CNAME Record :
----------------
CNAME stands for Cannonical Records ie URL to URL.
CNAME points a URL to any other URL.
we use it only for Non Root Domain.

5.Alias Record :
----------------
Alias Record points a URL to an AWS Resource.
Alias Record are used to map Resource RecordSet in our hosted Zone to Elastic Load Balancer,CloudFront or S3 Bucket Websites.

6.AAAA Record :
---------------
AAAA Record maps a Domain Name to the IPAddress(IPv6) of the Computer hosting the Domain.

7.MX Record :
-------------
MX Record stands for Mail Exchanger Record.
MX Record specifies the Mail Server responsible for accepting email Messages on behalf of Domain Name.
MX Record is a resource record in the DNS.
It is possible to configure several MX Records typically pointing to an Array of Mail Servers for Load Balancing and redundancy.

Routing Policies :
------------------
When we create a record we need to choose the routing policy which determines how Route53 responds to Queries.
There are total 6 types of Routing Policies 

1.Simple Routing Policy
2.Weighted Routing Policy
3.Latency Routing Policy
4.Failover Routing Policy
5.Geo Location Routing Policy
6.Multi Value Routing Policy

1.Simple Routing Policy :
-------------------------
This is the default Routing Policy.
In case of Simple Routing Policy we have only one record with Multiple IPAddresses.
This Routing Policy randomly selects the Routing path and does not take the resources status into Account.
Here all the IPAddress are randomly returned to the Client.
This can be used across Regions.
Create two Instances in two AWS Regions and add an "A" Record and add both EC2 Instance's Public IPAddress.

2.Weighted Routing Policy :
---------------------------
Weighted Routing Policy allows us to split the traffic based on the weights assigned.
We can associate Health Check with it.
This approach is heavily used in Blue Green Deployment.

3.Latency Routing Policy :
--------------------------
This policy is used when we have resources in Multiple Regions and we want to route traffic to the resources that provides the best latency.
The response to the request is purely measured by latency and not by the distance to the region of the resource.

4.Failover Routing Policy :
---------------------------
Failover Routing Policy allows us to route traffic to a resource when the resource is healthy or to a different resource when the resource is unhealthy.
For the Primary EndPoint it is required to associate a "Health Check" to do the Monitoring.
This allows the Routing Policy to route to the Secondary End Point when there is a Failure.

5.Geo Location Routing Policy :
-------------------------------
This Routing Policy allows us to route traffic to the resources based on geographic location of the Users ie location that the DNS query originates from.
Even when the geographic location has very high latency,Route53 always stick to the geographic location only.

6.Multi Value Routing Policy :
------------------------------
In case of Simple Routing Policy we have only one record with Multiple IPAddresses.
Where as in case of Multi value Routing Policy we need to create multiple "A" record sets for each IPAddress that we define.
With this approach we will be able to monitor each end point better than Simple Routing Policy by having health check attached to each Recordset.

What is Route 53 :
------------------
In today’s digital world, having a website or web application is essential for any business. 
But have you ever wondered how the internet knows where to send you when you enter a website’s domain name? 
It’s not magic; it’s a system that has been in place for decades. 
This system is called DNS, or Domain Name System, and it is responsible for translating human-readable domain names into IP addresses that computers can understand. 
Managing DNS can be complex and daunting task especially for businesses that want to ensure their website is always available to customers.

That’s where a powerful and reliable service like Amazon Route 53 comes in. 
Amazon Route 53 is a highly scalable and reliable DNS web service provided by AWS.
Route 53 is an impressive and reliable domain name system web service offered by Amazon. 
It’s highly scalable and available, making it a top choice for businesses of all sizes.

Why is it called Route 53 :
---------------------------
Route 53 is named after the port number 53, which is used for DNS traffic. 
Now, you might be wondering: What is DNS, and why is a service like Route 53 necessary?

What is DNS (Domain Name System) :
----------------------------------
A typical internet user might not realize that when they enter a web URL in the browser, there’s a lot happening behind the scenes. 
In simple terms, what’s happening is that the domain name is being mapped to a combination of numbers, known as IP addresses. 
This process is necessary for computers to communicate with each other over the internet, and DNS plays a critical role in making it happen seamlessly.

When a user types in a website like "google.com", they are essentially making a request to see the content hosted on that particular website. 
This request is served by a web server, which checks with the DNS server and asks, "Where can I find the website for google.com?" 
The DNS server then responds with the IP address where the website is hosted.

In simpler terms, DNS translates domain names (like "bestbuy.com") into IP addresses (like "192.168.1.1") that computers use to connect to one another. 
Route 53 provides a highly available and scalable DNS infrastructure, enabling developers to manage DNS traffic for their domain names. 
It allows them to route end users to internet applications by translating domain names into IP addresses.

Client Server Architecture :
----------------------------
In a client server architecture the client which is typically us makes requests to a server to get the details we want.
Similarly when visiting a website like bestbuy.com we are essentially making a request to access that website.
When we make a request to access a website the DNS server responds to us with the resolved IP address which allows us to connect to the actual server hosting the website.
For example the resolved IP address for a website could be 192.168.122.22.

Route53 is a DNS web service.
Route53 provides a highly available and scalable DNS infrastructure that enables developers to manage DNS traffic for their domain names.
Route53 allows the developers to Route end users to internet applications by translating domain names into IP addresses that computers use to connect to each other.
Route53 is a powerful and scalable DNS service offered by Amazon web services and 
DNS that we have here Maps domain names like example.com to IP addresses like 192.0.21.

With Route 53 you can manage and Route traffic to resources such as web servers,Email servers and much more but
we need to remember the three things that Route 53 is going to help you with.

1.Domain Registration
2.DNS Routing
3.Health Check

With AWS we can host a website and provide the users with the URL to connect to the website.
Route53 helps in managing the internet traffic to our domain names ensuring users are directed to the appropriate resources.

Consider the scenario where an End user is making a request to a web site.
Here request goes to the DNS Resolver.
Assume DNS Resolver as a directory where we resolve the queries on behalf of the end user.
With AWS route 53 we return the IP address of the DNS records that are queried by the DNS resolvers.
Resolving DNS queries means converting a user-friendly domain name into a computer friendly IP address.
When a user enters a website domain name in their browser their devices DNS resolver sends a query to the DNS server to find the IP address associated with that domain name.
It also helps check the health of the endpoint for high availability so that we know everything works fine.
Route53 also provides a user-friendly interface for creating hosted zones,managing traffic policies and propagating DNS records to its Global Network of authoritative DNS servers.

Route53 also helps in connecting to the endpoints or the endpoint instances where the website is actually hosted and for monitoring,logging and Analysis.
we make use of cloud watch by setting alarms and notification mechanisms and all of this is provided to you by AWS

What is a DNS Resolver :
------------------------
when a user enters a website's domain name in the web browser, DNS resolver on the device sends a query to a DNS server to look up the IP addresses associated with
that domain or the IP address associated with that domain.
This process allows us to connect easily to websites without the need to remember their IP addresses and 
DNS resolvers makes the internet more user friendly.
When you type the URL for Twitter that is www.witter.com on your browser.
The first thing we need to check is where is www.twitter.com
so this is done through a process called DNS lookup.
Browser sends a request to the DNS server to look up the IP address associated with the domain name you entered.
In this case it's twitter.com and the IP address is 157.233.2.0
Once the browser knows the IP address of the website it establishes TCP connection with the server that hosts the website and then the server receives the request and processes it.
It receives the requested content and sends it back to the browser as an HTTP response.
This is what happens when you try to visit a website.

What is Domain and Domain Registration :
----------------------------------------
Domain Registration is a process of acquiring a unique name that identifies a website on the internet and here we have the website URL.
Consider the example 

	https://www.google.com/search?q=example
	
First one is protocol.
Protocol is a set of instructions for two computers to talk to each other
Protocol provides a set of rules for how data should be formatted the order in which the message should be sent and how to handle errors or problems.
Commonly used protocol is https which stands for hypertext transfer protocol secure.
We already know HTTP I guess so this is a secure version of HTTP that is https.

Second one is domain itself which is our ww.google.com.
If you want yours you can get it on Route 53 or you can visit hostinger or godaddy.com.
Here www is called the Subdomain.
Subdomain is like a subcategory or subsection of a larger domain which is google.com.

Search here which is also called as page path.
page path is like an address or location that helps identify a specific page on a website.
Think of it like a book in a library.
Main domain name is equivalent to the library and the page path is like the specific shelf or location within the library where a particular book can be found.
This analogy can help you understand how a URL actually works.

Next one is the query string.
Query string is a way to add extra information to the end of the URL to help the website process request and provide specific information
Suppose we are searching for a query and that query is basically your example.
It will help the website to get that data for you.
For example in this URL the query string is Q equals to example and it tells a website to perform a search for the term example.

Domain Registration :
To register a domain name for our website you need to go through a domain registrar.
This is the company that manages the registration of domain names and helps you find an available domain name that suits your needs.
When searching for an available domain name you can use a domain registrar's website like hostinger or GoDaddy.
These websites provide a search bar where you can enter the domain name you want and check if it's available or not.
Once you find an available domain name that you like you can actually proceed with the domain registration process.
So if the domain name that you want is available then you can register it by following the instruction on the registrar's website.
The registrar has a registry that keeps all the records so that it can inform the registrar that if the domain is available or not.

One more important factor here which is called ICANN.
ICANN is Internet cooperation for assigned names and numbers.
It is a non-profit organization that plays a crucial role in managing the internet's domain name system.
ICANN actually manage as the root zones of the DNS which includes the list of all top level domains or TLD's such as .com,.org and .net etc.

Once everything is done you will need to provide some personal information and payment details and pay for the domain.
Then we can make use of the domain that we have purchased.

How does DNS Routing work :
---------------------------
What exactly happens when you type twitter.com browser.
When we type a URL in your browser it goes through a DNS resolver which acts as a middleman between your computer and the other three DNS servers.
The first touch point of the resolver is the root name server which helps find out what top level domain or TLD the domain uses like.com.org.net.
Now here you can see TLD for twitter.com is.com so once we get that it passes it on to the.com TLD server.
So after that the.com TLD name server contacts the Twitter Authoritative server which in turn converts the domain name into an IP address.
That's what is sent back to our computer and we get content to our browser because the browser now understands that twitter.com is 157.233.2.0.

Domain Chain :
--------------
Domain chain refers to the hierarchy of domain names in the domain name system.
Everything that we work on starts at the root i.e. DOT.
Below the root level domain are the top level domains or tlds.
Such as.com, .org, .net, .edu, .gov and so on.
Below the tlds are the second level domains or also called as slds such as google.com or netflix.com,rootserver.net.
Finally there may be third level domains such as www.google.com or it could be blog.wordpress.com which are subdomains of the second level domains.
SLD's represent a specific service or resource on that domain.

let's simplify things even further.
If we want to visit a website that is twitter.com.
We hit the URL and your browser talks to the DNS to find out the IP address associated with that.
If it has the IP in its cache translates it and sends it back to you.
If not the Name Server makes use of something called Name Server Record which is a type of DNS resource that specifies the Authoritative name servers for a particular domain.
Now we went one step further on reaching to the Authoritative name server.
Here this record contains information about the Authoritative Name Server responsible for answering DNS queries for the domain including their domain names and IP addresses.
So once you get back the information you send it to the browser again.
