***************************************************** 1.AWS RDS (Vishal Padghan)  *****************************************************

AWS RDS is a Web Service that makes it easier to set up,operate and scale Relational Database in the cloud.
RDS provides cost efficient,resizable and industry standard Relational Database and manages common Database Administration Tasks.
So RDS is not a Database and is a service that manages Database.
The Database's that RDS can manage are

Amazon Aurora
MySql
SQL Server
Oracle
MariaDB

Interesting part here is that RDS supports existing Relational Database.
We need not change the code of an Application or learn new Query Language for using RDS.
The difference between MySql and MySql which is managed by AWS RDS is that we need not worry about underlying Infrastructure or Administration of the Database.
Updation,Health monitor of the system on which MySql is installed,regular backup will be managed by AWS RDS.

AWS also offers EC2 Relational Database AMI's.
EC2 Relational Database AMI's allows us to fully manage our own Relational Database where as AWS RDS manages Database for us.

The Components in AWS RDS are

1.DB Instances
2.Regions and Availability Zones
3.Security Groups
4.DB Parameter Groups
5.DB Option Groups

1.DB Instances :
----------------
DB Instances are the building blocks of RDS.
It is an isolated Database environment in the cloud which contains multiple User created Database's.
This can be accessed using the tools and Applications similar to the stand alone Database Instance.
DB Instance can be created using AWS Management Console,AWS RDS API or AWS CLI.
The computation and memory capacity of the DB Instance depends on the DB Instance Class.
For each DB Instance we can select from 5 GB to 6 TB of associated Storage Capacity.
Types of DB Instances are

Standard Instances
Memory Optimized Instances
Micro Instances

2.Regions and Availability Zones :
----------------------------------
AWS Resources are housed in a highly available Date Center which are located across different parts of the world.
This Area is called Region.
Each Region has Multiple Availability Zones.
We can deploy our DB Instance in multiple Availability Zones and this ensures the Failover.
Failover Instance is called Stand By and the Original Instance is called Primary Instance.

3.Security Groups :
-------------------
Security Group control's the access to the Database Instance.
It can be done by specifying a range of IP Address or the EC2 Instance that we want to give access.

AWS RDS offers 3 types of Security Groups.
VPC Security Group : DB Instance inside a VPC
EC2 Security Group : Controls access to an EC2 Instance and can be used with a DB Instance
DB Security Group  : Controls the DB Instance that is not in VPC.

4.DB Parameter Groups :
-----------------------
It contains the Database configuration values that can be applied to one or more DB Instances of the same type.
If we don't apply DB Parameter group to an Instance,then default parameter group will be applied which has the default values.

5.DB Option Groups :
--------------------
Some DB Engine offers tools that simplify managing our Database's.
RDS makes these tools available with the use of Option Groups.

AWS RDS Advantages :
--------------------
1.When we talk about Database Services CPU,Memory,Storage and IO's are bundled together.We cannot control them individually.
with AWS RDS each of these parameters can be tweaked individually.

2.RDS manages the Database Servers,updates them with the latest software configuration and takes the back up automatically.
Backup can be taken in two ways.
Automated Backup's where in we set a time for Backup.
DB Snapshot's where in we manually take the Backup of our DB.

3.It Automatically creates a second Instance for Failover and provides high availability.

4.AWS RDS supports Read Replica's.
Snapshot's are created from source DB and all the read traffic to the source Database is distributed among read Replica's.
This reduces the overall head on the source DB.

5.AWS RDS can be integrated with IAM for giving customized access to the users who will be working on that Database.

6.Updates to the Database in AWS RDS are applied in Maintenance window.
Maintenance window is defined during the creation of DB Instance.
When an Update is available for our DB we get the Notification in the RDS Console and we can take one of the following actions.
Defer the Maintenance Items
Apply the Maintenance Items Immideately
Schedule Items for those Maintenance Items

Once the Maintenance starts DB Instance has to be taken offline for Maintenance.
If the Instance is running in Multi Availability Zone,In that case Stand By Instance is updated first and promoted to primary Instance.
Then Primary Instance is taken offline for updating.
This way the Application does not experience any down time.

If we want to scale the DB Instance,the changes to the new DB Instance will also happen during Maintenance window.
The Application will experience down time If it is in Single Availability Zone.
