HBase Introduction :
--------------------

HBase is a Hadoop Database
There are Two kinds of database 
SQL and NO(Not Only) SQL DataBase.

Because of Huge Velocity Of Data People Prefer HBase i.e No SQL DataBase.

No SQl has Relaxed lot of Features Compared to SQL.

NO SQL Relaxed Consistency, Validations.

SQL works on Schema on Write where as No Sql Works on Schema on Read.

While Writing the Data it wont perform any Schema on Write.

As there is no Validation we can store Huge Velocity of DataBase.

There are 125+  No Sql Databases are There.

Hadoop is a File System i.e Hadoop is a Distributed File System and we need one DataBase 
which can work on top of HDFS ,Here we Use HBase.

Oracle is a Indexed Network File System Similarly HBase is a Indexed Network File System
i.e Instead of Scanning the Whole File ,Sacns the Particular Data and Brings the Data.


HBase uses a File System Called Inedexed File System.
HBase is s Database on top of Haddop.

Whenver we want to go fro batch processing we go for HDFS and
Whenever we want to go for Real Time Processing we go For HBase.

Comparison Between SQL(RDBMS) and HBase


Create Table with Structure and Insert the Data where as 
In HBase First Create the Table  and the Create the Structure While Inserting the Data.

Id  Name      Age   Wife 
1   Srinivas  31    Nandini
2   Chary     0     Null


In HBase If We dont have any value for particular Record,Store only the Record that Contains the Data.
In Habse we dont see null values.

Dynamically we are going to define Structure.

While Creating the Table In HBase we should create Column Family(Atleast One).


Column family Example :

Id   Name   	Age  Wife  PhoneNo   OfficeName  OfficeAddress   OfficePhone


When I Ask Personal Details I dont want to touch  Office Details  Similarly
When I Ask Office Details I dont want to touch Personal Details.

In case of RDBMS It Scans the whole Record and it is time taken..


Here HBase Divides the data into Categories and we wiil give the Category Named based on 
Grouped Column.Here Grouped Column Name is Called Column Family.

While Creating the Table we have to create Atleast One Column Family.

Syntax :  Create 'Employee' 'Personal' 'Official'

HBase is only used for Aggregations.

RDBMS will write the Data into Row Format Similarly Read wiil be in the for of Row format.

In RDBMS if we want to perform some aggregation,it sacns the row and picks the column from each Row
because it is row oriented  both Read and Write Operations.

HBase is Column Oriented Database i.e It stores the Data in Column Oriented  and while Performing
Read Operation it  follows Row Oriented Format.
