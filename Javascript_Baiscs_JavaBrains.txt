****************************************** 1.What is Java Script	***************************************************

JavaScript is a Light weight,Interpreted,Object Oriented Language with First Class Functions and is best known as Scripting Language for Web Pages.
But it is used in Many Non Browser Environment as Well.

Light Weight :
--------------
Light Weight Language is Nothing But Easy to Implement and a Small Memory Foot Print.

Interpreted :
-------------
Interpreted Means No Compilation and Instructions are executed Directly.
JavaScript Compilation is Different from other Programming Languages Compilation.
In case of C++ or Java Intermediated Code will get Generated When we Compile the Code and we run that Code.
In C++ Object Binary got Generated where as In case of Java Byte Code got Generated.
We execute that Generated Code.
In Case of JavaScript there is no Intermediate File and the Code will be Executed Directly.

Java Script is Object Oriented :
--------------------------------
When we write the Code we Model the Code around Objects.
What are the Steps needed to Solve the Problem.
When we think about a Problem we Break it into the Objects with data and Functionality.

First Class Functions :
-----------------------
Functions can be used as Values.
We can Assign Function to a Variable.
We can pass Function as Parameters to Method Calls.

Java Script as Scripting Language :
-----------------------------------
In Scripting Language instructions are Written for a runtime Environment.
Best Example of Scripting Language is Shell Script.
We have Commands that we can run on Runtime Environment.
Here Runtime Environment Means Operating System.

We can also Bundle the Command and make them Execute as a File.
This becomes a Script that the Shell Executes at Runtime.

Here Runtime Environment is Browser.
Browser renders the HTML and runs the JavaScript.

When we make any Request to the Web Application Browser makes the Request to the Web Server.
Server Responds with Some HTML Content.
HTML we get as Response travels over HTTP and receives as Piece of Text.
Browser examines the Text and Convert them into Objects.
Here Each Tag becomes an Object Tree.
Tree Object refers to a DOM Tree.
Browser Builds the DOM Tree and renders the View to the Browser. 

Here HTML is a Static Language.
However HTML Comes with JavaScript and JavaScript is a Dynamic Language.
JavaScript has the ability to Manipulate the DOM Tree i.e

New Nodes can be added to the DOM Tree,
Removed form the DOM Tree or 
Update the Existing DOM Tree etc.
Browser Reflects the view based on the DOM Tree.
JavaScript is a way to execute Dynamic Functionality on Browser.

****************************************** 2.Why Java Script	***************************************************************

JavaScript can be Used For :

Client Side Web Development Because JavaScript is very Often used on Browser.
Native JavaScript
JQuery Library lets us Modify the DOM Tree on the Client Side.
Advanced Client Side Application Framework Like Angular,React,Ember,Backbone etc.
We can also Implement Server Side Web Development by Using NodeJs,Express .

We Can also build Browser extensions with JavaScript For Example Plug Ins.
There are Some Frameworks that allows to Build Desktop and Mobile Applications with JavaScript.
JavaScript is gaining Popularity with IOT Applications.

JavaScript is Standardized as ECMAScript.

****************************************** 3.Setting up Java Script  **********************************************************

Web Browser is a Runtime Environment for the JavaScript.
Recommended to use FireFox with ScratchPad Development Tool.

Install bebel 6 Plug In Visual Studio Code and run the Java Script as node hello.js
