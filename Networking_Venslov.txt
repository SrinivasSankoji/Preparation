****************************************************  1.OSI Model	*************************************************************************

OSI (Open Systems InterConnection) Model is a Conceptual Model that characterizes and Standardizes the communication mechanism of
TeleCommunication or Computing System without regard to its underlying Internal Structure and Technology.

Consider the scenario of without OSI Model.
Here we have to discuss the infrastructure of each networking system.
Networks are complex.
OSI Model uses a Layers to provide a high level description of what is going on within a particular networking System.
If the Network is broken OSI Model provides a way to quickly resolve the issue.
Whether it is the problem of Application or Physical Layer.

Network is a complicated system that comprised of numerous hosts,routers,data links,applications,protocols,hardware and software.
We need a way to understand it from high level.
This is where the OSI Model comes into picture.
In other words OSI Model is a tool used by IT Professionals to trace how the data is transferred between the networks.
How the network systems are supposed to communicate with each other.
OSI Model breaks down the data transfer procedure into different components called layers.
These Layers follows a proper order of execution.

Advantages of OSI Model :
1.It creates a common platform for software developers and hardware manfacturers in the creation of networking products
that can communicate with each other over the network.
2.It helps network administrators by dividing a large data exchange process into smaller segments.
3.Due to the independence of layers changes in one layer does not affect the other layer.
4.Standardization of network component allows multiple vendor development.

Layers Of OSI Model :
OSI Model is composed of Seven layers with the Application Layer at the top which is closest to the End User
and the Physical Layer at the bottom in which actual data transfer happens with the use of a transmission medium.

Application Layer :
-------------------
This is the top layer in the OSI Model where the end user interacts with.
Functionalities implemented at this layer are the ones that user interact with it directly.
Some of the Applications are Firefox,Skype are Application Level Software.
Applicaion Layer takes an input and transfers the data over the network.
When the Data is coming to the Application Layer it works on displaying the data to the end user.

Presentation Layer :
--------------------
This is the Layer in which Operating System operates with the data.
Because data going to and from the Application Layer is often not in the required format and has to be transported over the network.
It needs to be translated and presented properly to the next layer.

Presentation Layer is also called as "Translation Layer".
Presentation Layer translates the data from the network format to the Application format or vice versa.
An example of how secure communication is implemented in HTTPS.
Data is encrypted before transmission and decrypted upon arrival.

Session layer :
---------------
Session Layer manages the "Session" between two Machines.
For two devices on the network to communicate with each other "session" needs to be created to ensure the Authentication and Security.
Job of Session Layer is to establish,manage and terminates the session between two devices.
Whenever we visit a website our computer has to create a session with the web server of that website.

Transport layer :
-----------------
Transport Layer is the "traffic" control of the networks.
Some examples include TCP(Transmission Control Protocol) and UDP(User Datagram Protocol).

This Layer controls host-to-host data transfer and decides how much data can be sent at once,how fast we can send.
So whenever we are communicating with any website,Transport Layer will decide how much data can be transferred or recieved at any point of time.
Transportation Layer takes care of data segmentation and reassembly as well as flow and Error Control.

Data Segmentation :
Whenever data being sent is larger than the maximun transmission unit supported by the network Data Segmentation is needed.
Data Segmentation means dividing the data into smaller chunks prior to processing.
Sending the smaller amount of data at a time is beneficial.
Upon receiving the segmented data Transport Layer takes care of reassembling the data back to its original state.

Flow and Error Control :
When too much data is being sent at a time network congestion may happen.
Transport Layer will decide which data needs to be sent first and in which order to send the data to achieve maximum efficiency.
Sometimes data packest arrive corrupted or out of order.
Transport Layer will take care of how to get back the original data.
