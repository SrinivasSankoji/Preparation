************************************************* 1.Mockito Framework for Mocking in Unit Testing	*********************************************************

Unit Testing is Simple and effective technique to gain a good level of confidence in the code that has to be shipped.
Moreover it avoids regression issues with every piece of code that gets checked In.
With MicroServices kind of Architecture ie even for simple structure involving database calls straitforward,Unit Testing does not suffice.
What we need to do is mock the dependencies and test the actual logic of the method under the Test.

Mock/Stub is a term that people commonly hear while creating the Unit Test Cases in particular.
Mocking is nothing but providing a controlled instance or providing the implementation of the dependency that the code under the Test depends on in order to execute the Test Cases.
Here behavior of the dependency can be programmed or controlled as it is required for the code under the Test.

Almost every Application has primarily 3 Layers
User Interface
Business Layer
Data Access Layer

Consider the case of an Application like Google Maps can have dependencies on
1.Actual Data Store like MySql or any other No SQL Database which stores Map data.
2.An external service like CoordinateService which provides longitude and latitude of a location.
3.An external service like TrafficService which provides real traffic information for a given coordinate pair.

If someone is trying to validate the core business logic using Unit we need to have working implementation of those dependencies then only Test Cases will run. 
Mock comes in these situations whether the dependencies are available or not.
Mock always gaurantees to run the business logic by providing controlled instance of the dependency that's being called from the code under Test.

Types of Test Doubles :
-----------------------
Mock is a type of Test Double.
Test Double means an Object which is replaced by an equivalent Object or dependency.
There are 4 types of Test Doubles 

Fake
Stubs
Spies
Mocks

Fake :
------
Fake is a working implementation similar to real implementation expect the fact is that it is local to the system under Test.
Consider the scenario where we want to store the data into the Database.
Instead of calling the database,Test case will use the Collection or In Memory to store the Data.

Stubs :
-------
Stubs are preconfigured responses when a dependency is called from the System Under Test.

Spies :
-------
It is an actual function call with some watching mechanism.
Post the call we can verify whether the call was actually triggered or not along with parameters.

Mocks :
-------
Mocks are the special instances of the Objects on which stubbed/pre configured response can be specified.
The fact that the Mock got called can be verified by using an Assert Statement in the Test.
Consider the scenario of Report generator function which sends an Email to a specified Address during Execution.
As we don't want to send the Mail again and again during Testing,EmailService is Mocked.
The Method which sends the Email is configured to do nothing when it is called.
At the end of the Test we can verify that EmailService method got called through Mocked Object.

Example :
---------
Consider the scenario where we are trying to Unit Test an Application which calculates the Total marks for a Student in all the Subjects 
i.e. calculateSumAndStore() and stores it into Database.
If we want to write a Unit Test for a Method ie calculateSumAndStore(),then we might have a real implementation of a Database and store that Total.
In this case we won't be able to Unit Test this function.
But with Mock we can simply mock the Database Service and validate the rest of the logic.


************************************************* 5.SpringBoot Junit and Mockito (howtodoinjava) **********************************************************

We can create a Test class in two ways

1.MockitoJunitRunner :
----------------------
MockitoJunitRunner class automatically initializes all the Objects which are annotated with @Mock and @InjectMocks Annotations.

2.MockitoAnnotations.openMocks() :
----------------------------------
We can also use the Method to initialzie all the Objects which are annotated with @Mock and @InjectMocks i.e. MockitoAnnotations.openMocks().

@Mock :
-------
@Mock Annotation creates the Mock implementation for the class which is specified with it.

@InjectMocks :
--------------
@InjectMocks creates the Mock Implementation for the class which is specified with it and aditionally it injects the dependent Mocks that are Annotated with @Mock into it.

	@RestController
	@RequestMapping(path = "/employees")
	public class EmployeeController {
	@Autowired
	private EmployeeDao employeeDao;

	@GetMapping(path = "/", produces = "application/json")
	public List<EmployeeVO> getEmployees() {
		return employeeDao.getEmployeeList();
	}

	@PostMapping(path = "/", consumes = "application/json", produces = "application/json")
	public ResponseEntity<Object> addEmployee(@RequestBody EmployeeVO employee) {

		// add resource
		employeeDao.addEmployee(employee);

		// Create resource location
		URI location = ServletUriComponentsBuilder.fromCurrentRequest().path("/{id}")
				.buildAndExpand(employee.getEmployeeId()).toUri();

		// Send location in response
		return ResponseEntity.created(location).build();
	}
	}
	
	@ExtendWith(MockitoExtension.class)
	class EmployeeControllerTest {

	@InjectMocks
	EmployeeController employeeController;

	@Mock
	EmployeeDao employeeDao;

	@Test
	public void testAddEmployee() {
		MockHttpServletRequest request = new MockHttpServletRequest();
		RequestContextHolder.setRequestAttributes(new ServletRequestAttributes(request));

		when(employeeDao.addEmployee(ArgumentMatchers.any(EmployeeVO.class))).thenReturn(true);

		EmployeeVO employee = new EmployeeVO(1, "Lokesh", "Gupta", "howtodoinjava@gmail.com");
		ResponseEntity<Object> responseEntity = employeeController.addEmployee(employee);

		assertThat(responseEntity.getStatusCodeValue()).isEqualTo(201);
		assertThat(responseEntity.getHeaders().getLocation().getPath()).isEqualTo("/1");
	}
	}
