1.Vertex Introduction :
***********************
Vertex is a Polyglot Web Framework that Shares Common Functionalities among its Supported Languages Like Java,Kotlin etc.
Vertex Operates on Java Virtual Machine.

We can Measure the Performance of the Application by Fetching the Data From Database,Updating the Database and Delivering the Database.
The More Requests Served per Second the Better Performance.
Such an I/O Scenario where little Computing is involved,Non Blocking Framework would have and Edge.

Vertex Operates on a Single Event Loop and also takes the Advantage of JVM.
Vertex Maintain a Thread Pool with a Size that Can Match the Number of Available Cores .
With Concurrency Support,Vertex also Supports CPU Heavy Processing that Requires Parallel Computing.

Event Loops is the Main Part of Vertex.

Scenario :
----------
To Connect to a Database Client Requires a Connector Driver and the Most Commonly used JDBC Driver.
The Problem with Driver is Blocking and it Blocks at the Socket Level.
Thread will Always Stuck there Until it Receives the Response.
