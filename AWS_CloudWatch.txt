##############################################  1.AWS Cloud Watch Beginner’s Guide (kabeer1choudary) ###############################################

AWS CloudWatch is a monitoring service by AWS that helps track and analyze the performance of AWS resources in real-time. 
It offers insights to optimize applications and infrastructure by collecting and storing operational data like logs, metrics and events.

Metrics :
---------
Cloudwatch Metrics represents time-ordered data points related to AWS resources.
These Metrics can be CPU utilization, Memory usage, Disk I/O and more.
These Metrics can be defined by a Name, Namespace and Dimensions.

Logs :
------
Cloudwatch allows us to collect, monitor and analyze logs from various Applications and Services.
We can also use custom filters and queries to extract meaningful information from Logs.

Alarms :
--------
Cloudwatch Alarm helps us to set thresholds and Trigger actions based on metric data.
For example create an Alarm to notify when a CPU utilization exceeds a certain threshold.

Some of the usecases of AWS Cloudwatch are

Monitoring EC2 instances 
Analyzing Application logs
Autoscaling with Cloudwatch Alarms etc.

AWS Cloudwatch is a service from AWS which collects the datapoints or Logs from either Applications or other AWS Services which helps in Monitoring the current state
and allows us to create the action items to mitigate the issue.
AWS Cloudwatch also allows us to analyze the data we have in order to avoid the issue in the future.

The basic idea of using Cloudwatch is to send the logs to the resources that we are working with using Cloudwatch Agent.
The resources may be Service Logs, Application Logs, Load Balancer Logs, Instance Logs etc.
