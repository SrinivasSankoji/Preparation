1.Azure Storage      (AdamMarczak)     [16-AUG-2022]     ()



************************************************** 1.Azure Storage (AdamMarczak) **************************************************

One of the most important and critical tasks during the first stages of the project is picking the right storage solution.
Azure Storage is one of the most powerful one for storage.

Azure storage offers highly scalable object store for data Objects,File system for the cloud,Messaging store for reliable messaging and a NoSQL store.
Azure Storage is 

1.Durable i.e. Microsoft is handling all the Hardware Failure's.
2.Secure i.e. All the data is encrypted.
3.Scalabale i.e. It can handle all kind of data up to Peta bytes of data.
4.Managed
5.Accessible i.e. bunch of API's and SDK's allowing us to connect to the Storage.

There are current 4 services which are part of Storage Account.
1.Blob Storage
2.File Storage
3.Queue Storage
4.Table Storage

1.Blob Storage :
----------------
Blob storage is highly scalable object store for text and binary data.
Any kind of file that can be kept here.
Blob storage is ideal for
Serving images or documents directly to a browser.
Storing files for distributed access.
Streaming audio and video.
Storing data for back up and restore,disaster recovery and archiving.
Storing data for Analysis by an on premises or Azure hosted service.

Blob Storage is seperated in Containers.
Containers are similar to partition in the drive.
Containers are the entry point for the data.
Each Containers contains one or more files.
Containers are just a flat hierarchy of files.

Blob Storage Access Tier :
--------------------------
Azure Storage provides different options for accessing blob data based on usage patterns.
Hot : optimized for frequent access of Objects.The hotter the storage,higher the cost.
Cool : optimized for storing large amounts of data that is infrequently accessed and stored for at least 30 days.
Here we need to pay additional fee for retrieving the data.
Archive : optimized for data that can tolerate several hours of retrieval latency and will remain in the archive for 180 days.
Here we don't expect our data to be retrieved at all.

2.File Storage :
----------------
