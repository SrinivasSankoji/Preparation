16.AWS EC2 Use Case

1.Drawback :
------------
It is very difficult to predict how much computing power required for an Application that has just launched.
There may be two scenarios.
We may over estimate the requirement and increase the stack of servers which will be of no use.
We may under estimate the requirement which leads to the crash of an Application.

2.Introduction :
----------------
EC2 is a service from Amazon that provides a resizable computing services on the cloud.
Resizable because we can quickly scale up or scale down the number os server instances we are using if the computing requirement changes.

3.Instance :
------------
Instance is a Virtual Server for running Application on EC2.
It can be considered as a tiny part of a large computer,whcih has its own harddrive,network connection,os etc.
We can have multiple tiny computers on a single physical server and each tiny machine is called as an instance.
EC2 is a service along with other services like S3.
When we use EC2 or any other service we use it through a instance i.e t2.micro instance for EC2.

4.Why EC2 :
-----------
As a Developer if we want to work independently, we need to buy a stack of servers.
We estimated the correct capacity and the computing power is enough.
The problem here is If there is any problem in the stack of servers we need to troubleshoot the issue.
We may laso need to hire the team to maintain the stack of servers.
Based on load we cannot scale up or scale down the servers with immideate effect.
There are some other problems which makes the EC2 stronger.

5.Types of Computing Instances :
--------------------------------
Computing is a very broad term and the nature of task decides what kind of computing we need.
AWS EC2 offers 5 types of instances 

General Instances
Compute Instances
Memory Instances
Storage Instances
GPU instances

General Instances :
For Applications that require a balance of perfromance and cost.
Consider the case of Email Responding Systems where we need a prompt response as well as cost effective because it doesn't require much processing.

Compute Instances :
For Applications that requires a lot of processing from the CPU.
Example : Analysis of data from a stream of data like Twitter.

Memory Instances :
For Applications that are heavy in nature and requires a lot of RAM.
Consider the scenario where lot of Applications are running in the background i.e multitasking

Storage Instances :
For an Application that are huge in size or occupies a lot of space.

GPU instances :
For Applications that requires some heavy graphics rendering.
Consider the scenario of 3D modelling etc.

Note :
Every instance type has a set of instances which are optimized for different work loads.

General Instances  : t2,m3,m4
Compute Instances  : c3,c4
Memory Instances   : r3,x1
Storage Instances  : i2,d2
GPU instances      : g2

6.Burstable Performance Instances :
-----------------------------------
T2 instances are burstable instances.
This means CPU performs at a baseline of its Capacity.Consider the case of 20 Percent of CPU.
When the Application needs more than 20% of the performance of the CPU,then CPU enters into burst mode giving the higher performance for a limited amount of time.
Therefore work happens faster.

We get the Credits when the CPU is idle.
Each CPU credit gives a burst of 1 Minute to the CPU.
Every time a burst happens in a CPU,CPU credits are used.
If CPU credits are not used they are credited to your account and stay for 24 Hours.
Based on Credit Balance we can decide whether t2 instance should be scaled up or scaled down.

Example :
Customer Analysis Data i.e Customer's Website Activity should be monitered real time.
There will be a time where the tarffic to the website is minimum.
In this Case high processor is not required and is expensive for the company.
We may use t2 instance beacuse it will give burstable CPU performance.
Whenever traffic to the website is high CPU performance will be increased automatically.

7.EBS-Optimized Instances : 
---------------------------
C4,M4 and D2 instances are EBS optimized by default.
EBS means Elastic Block Storage which is a storage option provided by AWS in which the IOPS rate is high.
When an EBS Volume is attached to an optimized instance,Single Digit milli seconds latency can be acheived.

IOPS i.e Input Output Operations per Second is a performance measurement used to characterizecomputer storage devices.

Example :
Auto Response Mailing System.
Here Response should be quick and We would require a system where the response time is as short as possible.
This can be acheived by using EBS optimized instances where the IOPS is high and low latencies.

8.Cluster Networking Instances :
--------------------------------
M4,C4,C3,X1,I2,D2,G2 instances support cluster networking.
The instances are launched into a common placement group are put in a logical group that provides a high bandwidth and 
low latency between all the instances in the group.

Placement group is a Logical Cluster where some selected EC2 instances which are part of that group can utilize upto 10 GB for single flow
and 20 GB for multiflow traffic in each direction.

Instances which are not part of placement Group are limited to 5 GBPS speed in Multiflow Traffic.
Note :
Cluster networking is ideal for high performance analytics system.

Example :
Search Engine on our Website
It should be able to sort the records and return the relevant results.
Here we might require two servers i.e one server is for database and another server is for processing the keywords.
Communication between the two servers should be at the maximum possible rate.
To acheive this we need to put them in a placement group and for that we use Cluster Networking instances.

9.Dedicated Instances :
-----------------------
These are the instances that run on a single tennant-hardware dedicated to a single cutomer.

Example :
Some processes in every organization are highly confidential.

11.How to run systems in EC2 :
------------------------------
Login to AWS Account and clck on AWS EC2.
Under Create instance,Click on Launch Instance.
Whenever we want to Launch an Instance we have to specify which AMI we want to use.It can be Ubuntu,Windows etc.

Select the AMI.AMI's are Templates of OS and they provide the information needed to Launch an Instance.
1.AMI's could be preconfigured or we can configure on its own.
For preconfigured AMI's we have to select it from market place.
For setting up our own,go to quick start and select one.
2.While configuring AMI we will reach a point where we have to select an EBS Storage Option.

EBS i.e Elastic Block Storage is a persistent block level Storage Volume that can be used along with EC2.
Here each block acts as a hard drive.
Just like Computer needs a Hard drive,EC2 needs a Storage Volume to store the OS which we have specified during the instance creation.
Optons for EBS are 

1.Provisioned IOPS :
This category is for workloads which are mission critical i.e it provides high IOPS rates.
2.General Purpose :
This category is for workload which needs performance and cost balance.
3.Magnetic :
This category is for workloads where the data is accessed less frequently and retreival time is more.

After selecting the suitable option in EBS,we give a name for an instance and then we create the Security Group.
Security Group acts as a firewall to control Inbound and Outbound traffic.
Each Security Group has rules according to which the traffic is governed.
Each instance can be assigned upto 5 Security Groups.

Finally we can see the console that shows all the settings that we have done,verify and launch the instance.

12.Security in AWS EC2 :
------------------------
When we launch the instance we need to provide the Authentication otherwsie any one can access the EC2 instance.
To Authenticate users to their Instances,AWS employs a key value pair method.

EC2 uses a public-key and private-key cryptography to encrypt and decrypt login information.
public-key cryptography uses the public-key to encrypt the piece of data such as password.
Then the recepient uses the private-key to decrypt the data.
public-key and private-key are known as key value pair.

13.Auto Scaling :
-----------------
Auto Scaling is a service designed in AWS EC2 in which we can automatically Launch or terminate instances based user-defined profiles,
schedules and health checks.

14.Elastic Load Balancing :
---------------------------
Elastic Load Balancing automatically distributes incoming Application traffic across multiple EC2 instances
in multiple availability zones.
Availability zones are the places where Amazon has set up their servers.
Since they have the customers from the globe they have set up multiple Availability Zones to reduce the latency.

Elastic IP Address are static IP Address that are associated with our AWS Account.
They can be used to mask the failure of an instance by automatically remapping our address to another working instance in our Account.

15.AWS EC2 Pricing :
--------------------
AWS EC2 Free tier allows 750 Hours of t2.micro instance usage per month.
Free Tier is valid for 1 year.

There are three pricing options in AWS EC2.

1.Spot Instances
The price we set for EC2 is hourly basis.
The moment where the price of the instance becomes greater than what we have set,the instance shut downs automatically.

2.On Demand Instances
These are used when we want to pay for the hour with no long term commitments ad upfront payments.
These are useful for Applications deployed for the first time or test Applications.

3.Reserved Instances
With this we can have reserved instances for a specific period of time with 3 payment options and 2 terms.

No Upfront
Partial Upfront
Full Upfront

1 Year Term
3 Year Term
