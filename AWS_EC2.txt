16.AWS EC2 Use Case

1.Drawback :
------------
It is very difficult to predict how much computing power required for an Application that has just launched.
There may be two scenarios.
We may over estimate the requirement and increase the stack of servers which will be of no use.
We may under estimate the requirement which leads to the crash of an Application.

2.Introduction :
----------------
EC2 is a service from AWS that provides a resizable computing capacity in the cloud.
Other services include S3,ECS,IAM etc.
Resizable because we can quickly scale up or scale down the number of server instances as per our computing requirements.

EC2 is a way of running the computer in the cloud.
In EC2 we can launch Linux Machine,Windows Machine etc.
EC2 is like having a Computer at the push of a Button.

In EC2 we can run different type of workloads.
We can install wordpress to build a web site.We can also install database and store data directly on EC2.
Imagine we can run everything on EC2.

Note :
Since EC2 is more flexible we don't run everything on EC2.
If we run the database on EC2 we need to manage ourself.
AWS offers RDS which takes care of maintaining our own database.
Here AWS runs it under the hood of EC2.

Note :
When we use EC2 or any other service we use it through an Instance i.e t2.micro instance for EC2.

3.Instance :
------------
Instance is a virtual Server for running Application on EC2.
It can be considered as a tiny part of a large computer,whcih has its own harddrive,network connection,os etc.
We can have multiple tiny computers on a single physical server and each tiny computer is called as an Instance.

4.Why EC2 :
-----------
As a Developer if we want to work independently, we need to buy a stack of servers.
We estimated the correct capacity and the computing power is enough.
The problem here is If there is any problem in the stack of servers we need to troubleshoot the issue.
We may also need to hire the team to maintain the stack of servers.
Based on load we cannot scale up or scale down the servers with immideate effect.
There are some other problems which makes the EC2 stronger.

5.Types of EC2 Instances :
--------------------------
Computing is a very broad term and the nature of task decides what kind of computing we need.
AWS EC2 offers 6 types of instances 

General Instances
Compute Instances
Memory Instances
Storage Instances
Accelerated Computing instances

General Instances :
For an Application that require a balance of perfromance and cost effective.
Consider the case of Email responding systems where we need a prompt response as well as cost effective because it doesn't require much processing.

Compute Instances :
For an Application that requires a lot of processing from the CPU.
Example : Analysis of data from a stream of data like Twitter.

Memory Instances :
For an Application that are heavy in nature and requires a lot of RAM.
Consider the scenario where lot of Applications are running in the background i.e multitasking.

Storage Instances :
For an Application that are huge in size or occupies a lot of space.

Accelerated Computing instances :
For an Application that requires heavy graphics rendering.
Consider the scenario of 3D modelling etc.

Note :
Every instance has a set of instance type which are optimized for different work loads.

General Instances  : t2,m3,m4
Compute Instances  : c3,c4
Memory Instances   : r3,x1
Storage Instances  : i2,d2
Accelerated Computing instances      : g2

6.Burstable Performance Instances :
-----------------------------------
T2 instances are burstable instances.
This means CPU performs at a baseline of its Capacity.Consider the case of 20 Percent of CPU.
When the Application needs more than 20% of the CPU,then CPU enters into burst mode giving the higher performance for a limited amount of time.
Therefore work happens faster.

We get the CPU Credits when we create an Instance.
Every hour we get certain amount of CPU credits automatically and this depends on type of Instance.
Every time a burst happens in a CPU,CPU credits are used.Each CPU credit gives a burst of 1 minute to the CPU.
If CPU credits are not used they are credited to your account and stay for 24 Hours.
If we are out of CPU credits,Instance will work on CPU baseline performance.
Based on CPU credit balance we can decide whether t2 instance should be scaled up or scaled down.

Example :
Customer's Website Activity should be monitered real time.
There will be a time where the traffic to the website is minimum.
In this Case high processor is not required and is expensive for the company.
We may use t2 instance beacuse it will give burstable CPU performance.
Whenever traffic to the website is high CPU performance will be increased automatically.

7.EBS-Optimized Instances : 
---------------------------
C4,M4 and D2 instances are EBS optimized instances by default.
EBS(Elastic Block Storage) is a persistent block level storage volume that can be used along with EC2 in which IOPS rate is high.
Here Each block acts as a Harddrive.
When an EBS Volume is attached to an EC2 Instance,Single Digit milli seconds latency can be acheived.

Note :
IOPS(Input Output Operations per Second) is a performance measurement used to characterize computer storage devices.

Example :
Auto Response Mailing System.
We would require a system where the response time is as short as possible.
This can be acheived by using EBS optimized instances where the IOPS rate is high and low latency.

8.Cluster Networking Instances :
--------------------------------
M4,C4,C3,X1,I2,D2,G2 instances support cluster networking.
The instances that are launched into a common placement group and kept in a logical group that provides a high bandwidth and 
low latency between all the instances in the group.

Placement group is a Logical Cluster where some selected EC2 instances which are part of that group can utilize upto 10 GB for single flow
and 20 GB for multiflow traffic in each direction.
Instances which are not part of placement Group are limited to 5 GBPS speed in Multiflow Traffic.

Note :
Cluster networking is ideal for high performance analytics system.

Example :
Search Engine on our Website
It should be able to sort the records and return the relevant results.
Here we might require two servers i.e one server is for database and another server is for processing the keywords.
Communication between the two servers should be at the maximum possible rate.
To acheive this we need to put them in a placement group and for that we use Cluster Networking instances.

9.Dedicated Instances :
-----------------------
These are the instances that run on a single tennant-hardware and dedicated to a single cutomer.

Example :
Some processes in every organization are highly confidential.

11.How to run systems in EC2 :
------------------------------
Login to AWS Account and click on AWS EC2.
Under Create instance Click on Launch Instance.
Whenever we want to launch an Instance we have to specify which AMI we want to use.It can be Ubuntu,Windows etc.

Select the AMI.AMI's are Templates of OS and they provide the information needed to launch an Instance.
1.AMI's could be preconfigured or we can configure on its own.
For preconfigured AMI's we have to select it from market place.
For setting up our own,go to quick start and select one.
2.While configuring an AMI,we will reach to a point where we have to select an EBS.

EBS i.e. Elastic Block Store is a persistent block level storage volume that can be attached to an EC2 instance.
Here each block acts as a Hard drive.
Just like Computer needs a Hard drive, EC2 needs a storage volume to store the OS which we have specified during the instance creation.

Optons for EBS are 
1.Provisioned IOPS :
This category is for workloads which are mission critical i.e. it provides high IOPS rates.
2.General Purpose :
This category is for workloads which needs balance of performance and cost effective.
3.Magnetic :
This category is for workloads where the data is accessed less frequently and retreival time is more.

After selecting the suitable option in EBS,provide a name for an instance and then create the Security Group.

Security Group :
----------------
Security Group acts as a firewall to control Inbound and Outbound traffic.
Each Security Group has rules according to which the traffic is governed.
Each Instance can be assigned upto 5 Security Groups.

Finally we can see the console that shows all the settings that we have done,verify and launch the instance.

12.Security in AWS EC2 :
------------------------
Whenever we launch an EC2 instance we need to provide the Authentication otherwise any one can access the EC2 instance.
To Authenticate the users to their instances AWS offers a key value pair method.

EC2 uses a public-key and private-key cryptography to encrypt and decrypt login information.
public-key cryptography uses the public-key to encrypt the piece of data such as password.
Then the recepient uses the private-key to decrypt the data.
public-key and private-key are known as key value pair.

13.Auto Scaling :
-----------------
Auto Scaling is a service provided in AWS using which we can automatically scale up or scale down the EC2 instances 
based on user-defined profiles,schedulers and health checks.

14.Elastic Load Balancing :
---------------------------
ELB accepts the incoming network traffic from the client and distributes the traffic across multiple EC2 instances in multiple availability zones.
Availability zones are the places where Amazon has set up their servers.
Since they have the customers across the globe they have set up multiple Availability Zones to reduce the latency.

Elastic IP Address's are the static IP Address's that are associated with our AWS Account.
They can be used to mask the failure of an instance by automatically remapping our address to another working instance in our Account.

15.AWS EC2 Pricing / Purchasing options :
-----------------------------------------
AWS EC2 Free tier allows 750 Hours of t2.micro instance usage per month.
Free Tier is valid for 1 year.

There are three pricing options in AWS EC2.

1.Spot Instances
The price we set for EC2 is hourly basis.
The moment when the price of the instance becomes greater than what we have set,the instance shut downs automatically.

2.On Demand Instances
These are used when we want to pay for the hour with no long term commitments and upfront payments.
These are useful for Applications deployed for the first time or to Test Applications.

3.Reserved Instances
With this we can have reserved instances for a specific period of time with 3 payment options and 2 terms.

No Upfront
Partial Upfront
Full Upfront

1 Year Term
3 Year Term

Launch Template :
-----------------
Launch Template is a feature in EC2 which reduces the number of steps that are required to create an EC2 instance by capturing all the launch parameters within one resource.
Before creating an Auto scaling group we need to create a Launch Template with the parameters required to launch an EC2 instance.
These parameters includes AMI Id, Instance type,EBS provisioned IOPS, EBS Volume tagging, T2 unlimited instance, Elastic Inference and Dedicated Host etc.

###########################################  15.EC2 Instance types (DGR Uploads) ##################################################################

AWS provides a wide range of EC2 instance types that are optimized for different use cases.
Instance type comprises of varying combination of CPU, Memory storage and Network capacity.
This gives us the flexibility to choose the most appropriate mix of resources for the applications.
Each Instance type includes one or more instance sizes that allows us to scale the resources based on target workloads.

1.General purpose
2.Compute optimized
3.Memory optimized
4.Storage optimized
5.Accelerated computing
6.HPC optimized

https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/instance-types/

1.General purpose :
-------------------
General purpose instance provides a balance of compute, memory and networking resources and can be used for a variety of diverse workloads.
These instances are ideal for an application that use the resources in equal proportions such as Web Servers, Code repositories etc.
For an Application that require a balance of perfromance and cost effective.
Consider the case of Email responding systems where we need a prompt response as well as cost effective because it doesn't require much processing.

2.Compute optimized :
---------------------
For an Application that requires a lot of processing from the CPU we use Compute optiized instance.
Instances belonging to this category are well suited for below applications.

Batch processing workloads
Media transcoding
High performance web servers
High performance computing (HPC) 
Scientific modeling
Dedicated gaming servers
Ad server engines
Machine learning inference
Compute intensive applications like Twitter where we analyse the data from a stream of data.

3.Memory optimized :
--------------------
Memory optiized instances are designed to deliver fast performance for workloads that process large datasets in memory.
Memory optimized instances are ideal for Memory-intensive workloads such as open source databases, in-memory caches, and real-time big data analytics.
For an Application that are heavy in nature and requires a lot of RAM.
Consider the scenario where lot of Applications are running in the background i.e. multitasking.

4.Storage optimized :
---------------------
For an Application that are huge in size or occupies a lot of space.

Storage optimized instances are designed for workloads that require high, sequential read and write access to very large data sets on local storage. 
They are optimized to deliver tens of thousands of low-latency, random I/O operations per second (IOPS) to applications.

Storage optimized instances are optimized for I/O intensive applications and are targeted to customers using transactional databases (Amazon DynamoDB, MySQL, and PostgreSQL), 
Amazon OpenSearch Service, and real-time analytics such as Apache Spark.

5.Accelerated computing :
-------------------------
For an Application that requires heavy graphics rendering.
Consider the scenario of 3D modelling etc.

Accelerated computing instances use hardware accelerators or co-processors to perform functions.
Such as floating point number calculations, graphics processing, data pattern matching more efficiently than is possible in software running on CPUs.


6.HPC optimized :
-----------------
High performance computing (HPC) instances are purpose built to offer the best price performance for running HPC workloads at scale on AWS. 
HPC instances are ideal for applications that benefit from high-performance processors such as large, complex simulations and deep learning workloads.
