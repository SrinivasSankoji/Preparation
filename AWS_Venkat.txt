***************************************************************  1.AWS Free Tier Account   **********************************************************

Login into  https://aws.amazon.com/
Select the Region -- Asia Pacific Mumbai.

*************************************************************** 2.Create an Admin User **************************************************************

If we access the AWS account using Email then that will be the Root Account.
Root Account has an access to everything including Billing Information.
Here we need to create an Additional User and start using that User to create the Resources.
Newly created User does not have an access to Billing but has full admin Access.

To create a New User

	Services --> IAM --> Select User --> Add User 
	Enter UserName
	Enter Custom Password
	Attach the Permission Policy
	Select Admin
	Select Access Key and Access Token
	Review and Close.
	
Copy the URL and Login as IAM User.
Now we can see all the services which are similar to Admin User.


***************************************************************  3.AWS Billing Alert  *************************************************************** 

Login as Root User
Billing Dashboard  --> Biling preferences --> Select the Recieve Free Tier Usage Alerts and Recieve Billing Alerts 
Then Select the Manage Billing Alerts Link

Billing Alerts can be done using CloudWatch.
Select the Billing --> Create an Alarm --> Select the Threshold Type --> Static,Greater and 5 USD  --> Next
Select In Alarm, Create a New Topic --> Topic Name and Mail Id --> Click on Create Topic.
Confirm the Alarm for the given MailId.


*************************************************************** 4.Install AWS CLI  ******************************************************************



*************************************************************** 5.Launching EC2 instance ************************************************************

Whenever we create an AWS Account by default it has VPC and we need to place the resources in the VPC.
AWS creats a default VPC for us public subnet will be created for each Availability Zone and Region and attached to the Internet Gateway.
Also it comes with the default Security Group.
Inbound Traffic is allowed only for Machines within the same Security Group.

Note:
Any machine which are in the same Security Group can communicate with Each Other.

Security Group are like firewalls.
We attach the Security Group to an EC2 instance.
We can also attach Multiple Security Groups to any EC2 instance.
We can also define what Machines can connect our Machine on which port,How to open the Port etc.

Once we launch the Virtual Machine or EC2 instance we are going to connect via SSH from our Host Machine.
We need to open the Port 22.

Requirement to create an EC2 instance are
In which VPC we are going to depoly that
Which Subnet
Which Availability Zone
What Security Group we want to put in that Instance
Whether we need a Public IP for that Instance
Finally we need to have a SSH key pair to access the EC2 Instance

Step 1:
Create the KeyPair
It will be proviiding a .pem file
Whenever the Machine is launched AWS put the public key inside the EC2 instance.
AWS does not store the private key and this is the last chance to store private key. 

Note:
We can also create the new key pair if required.

Step 2 :
Select the instances --> Launch the Instance --> Select the AMI --> 
Herw we can have our own AMI's,community AMI's 

Select Amazon Linux -->
Her the root device type is EBS.
Default image includes AWS CLI,Python,Ruby,PERL,Java Repositories include Docker,PHP,MySql,PostgreeSql etc.
Select t2 micro instance --> Depending on what we select we get the CPU,Storage,Memory and so on  --> Next
Select the Number of Instances 
Selct the Network ie VPC where we want to deploy our EC2 instance and select the default VPC.
Select the subnet as default
Select Auto Assign Public IP as Subnet City i.e enable Public IP
Select the Enable Terminate Option i.e we cannot terminate the instance by default.
If we enter the Commands in the Advanced Configuration --> User Data --> then those commands will be executed at the time of EC2 instance launch.

Step 3 :
Click on Next Add Storage -->
By default delete on termination is checked ie if we terminate the EC2 instance EBS will be deleted.
Let it be checked

Step 4 :
Click on Add Tags --> env and web
We can add upto 50 Tags

Step 5 :
Configure the Security Group
Here we can create the New Security Group or use the existing Security Group.
Default Security Group des not have any inbound Rules.
Create the Security Group --> 
Type : SSH
Protocol : TCP
Port : 22
Source : Select MyIP .Here if we select the Custom IP then it is publicly Available although it has SSH key value Pair.
Finally Review and Luanch.

Step 6:
Here it will ask the Key value pair.
Selct the existing key value pair and launch the Instance.

Step 7:
View the Instances
Here we can create the Alarms but it is cost effective.
If the CPU percent is above 90 percent in an Hour we can raise an Alarm.
Select the Volume --> Here EBS Volume got created.
New Security Group got created.
New Key Pairs got created

Select the Instances --> Copy the IP Address --> Open the Terminal --> 
Select the pem file
Default user for AWS instance ec2-user@Public IP Address
Run the command user-r

Note:
Whenever we create a Machine we can configure it and we can make that into an Image.

Note :
We have an option to enable or disable Auto Assign Public IP.
Whenever we are creating Machines that does not need an external access or we don't have to log into those machines from Internet
we can disable those AMchines and we only get the private IP Address but not public IP Address.
Machine will not be reachable from the Internet.

Usecase :
Consider the case of Web Two Tier Architecture.
We have Web Tier and Databse Tier.
We put the Database Tier on the Private Subnet so that Database Server cannot be accessed directly.
Web Server will be in the Public Subnet because that needs to be exposed to the public.
Private Subnet needs to be accessed from the Public Subnet.

Finally 
Delete the Instance
Delete the Key Pair
Delete the Security Group
