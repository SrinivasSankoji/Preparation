********************************************************************* 1.AWS Introduction  *********************************************************************

Whenever we get a new project from any Organization,
we need to understand the requirement,How long it will take to develop the specific Application and requirements to implement the Application.


					Application
					Runtimes
					Security and Integration
					Databases
					Servers
					Virtualization
					Server Hardware
					Storage
					Networking

Once the Application is finalized we need to get 

How much Storage devices are required
How much Server Hardware is required 
Networking devices required to connect the Server Hardware

we need to connect all the three i.e Storage,Server and Network Devices.
Finally we need a Network Admin who will create a Virtualization Layer on top of these Hardwares.
Virtualization helps in providing different kind of systems on the same server.
Here we can have both Linux Machine as well as Windows Machine on the Same Server.
Once the Virtualization is completed Architect comes into the picture and he will create a Server based on his requirement on the virtual machine.
Architect will also design the database.
Once the Server and Database are designed by Architect,Developer will start implementing the Application and run those Applications.
Security Engineer will ensure all of them are tightly integrated and secured from any Attacks.
This is how the traditional IT Company works till now.

Once the Cloud came into the picture,solution is divided into 3 parts.

Infrastructure as a Service
Platform as a Service
Software as a Service

In case of Infrastructure as Service we do not worry about setting up the 
Hardware Components,
Networking Components 
Storage Components 
Virtualization etc.
Here we are asking the Cloud vendor to provide the Linux Server with some configuration.
It is best suitable for the Solution Architects that helps in saving the cost.

In case of Software as a Service we directly use the Application.
Example are GoogleDrive,Gmail,Apps on Android etc.
It is best suitable for the End Users.

In case of Platform as a Service we only need to implement the Application.
If we want to implement a Java Application we need a Linux Server with Java installed on it.
It is best suitable for the Application Developers.

Difference between Traditional Infrastructure and AWS Services :
----------------------------------------------------------------
Whenever we are going to get any project,Company purchases lot of Servers,Racks and storage devices like DAS,SAN,NAS,RDBMS etc.
All of these are interconnected using Router,Pipelines and switches etc.by the Administrator.
Administrator is going to provide the Firewall and security for the complete Infrastructure.

Compared to On Premise Servers we also have Servers in the AWS Cloud.
AWS has a ready image i.e AMI(AMazon Machine Image) for Windows OS,Linux OS etc.
Pick up the ready image and start the EC2 instance (Elastic Compute Cloud).EC2 is also called as virtual machine.

In Traditional Networking we have Routers,Pipelines,Switches that connects with the Servers,Storage Devices and Databases etc.
In Case of AWS we have Load Balancers that directly connects to the Virtual Servers and it balances the complete Load.
How much traffic can flow to each virtual server is decided by Load Balancer.

We can also create our own VPC(Virtual Private Cloud) in which we can connect all the devices i.e servers,databases etc.
We can also create our own Security Groups,NACL's(Networl Access Control List).
Whatever Network we are going to build we are going to secure with Security Groups and NACL's.

Compared to Traditional Architeture we have Network Administrators who are going to provide priviliges.
In case of AWS we have to use IAM Services to provide the Access rights.

For the traditional Sequential Databases we have AWS RDS Service.
For Storage of File system like images,static Files etc we have AWS S3(Simple Storage Service).
To spin up the OS,Store,install and run the Software we have AWS EBS(Elastic Block Store).

We have Elastic File System that automatically grows and shrinks.
He are we are going to pay for the data that we are using.

Advantages of AWS Cloud Computing :
-----------------------------------
Trade Capital expense for variable expense.
Benefits from Massive economies of sale.
Stop guessing about capacity.
Increase speed and agility.
Stop spending money on running and maintaining Data Center.
Go Global in Minutes.

AWS Platform :
--------------
AWS Global Infrastructure
Networking

Compute 
Storage
Database
Security and Identity

AWS Global Infrastructue is about 2 things i.e Regions and Availablity Zones.
Region is nothing but Geographic Location and consists of atleast 2 Availablity Zones.
Availablity Zone is nothing but cluster of Data Centers and isolted from failures in other Availablity Zones.
All the Availablity Zones are inter connected with each other.

In case of Networking,
How to set up our own private Cloud
How to Host websites usiing Route 53
How we can get a Direct Connect with AWS Cloud Platform by  bypassing the Internet.


In Case of Compute,
EC2 i.e Virtual Machine

In Case of Storage we have
S3
EFS
Cloud Front
Glacier
Storage Gateway

In Case of Databases we have
RDS
RedShift
DynamoDB
ElasticCache
DMS (Database Migration Service)

*********************************************************************  2.AWS Certified Solution Architect  **********************************************************

Public Cloud :
Here Infrastructure is provided by the Cloud Vendor.

Private Cloud :
For a long time we have been into the private Cloud Model.
Here Organizations built their own data centers inside the Building.
Application Built here is used only within the Organization.

Hybrid Cloud :
It is combination of Both private CLoud and Public Cloud.


AWS Account :
-------------



*********************************************************************  16.IAM Roles and Policies   ******************************************************************

IAM is a part of Security.
Consider the scenario we have created an Account for AWS in a Company and have to do the complete Set up.
First thing we are going to look into is IAM.
This is the place we are going to add the Users and who will have the access to my AWS Account and which User have the what Level of Access.
IAM stands for Identity and Access Management which allows the user to access and their level of Access.

Advantages of IAM :
-------------------
1.Centralized control of AWS Account.
2.Shared Access for AWS Account (Multiple Administrators)
3.Granular Permissions (Until what level user can have a specific Access.We can also defind the specific documnet)
4.Identity Federation
If the company got more than 1000 users it is difficult to add each user in IAM section.
Here we integrate the Active Dircetory so that all the  users can use the Id and password of the company itself.
We can also do the Identity Federation with Facebook and LinkedIn.
5. MultiFactor Authentication (Two Level Authentication)
6.Provide Temporary Accss for users/devices and services wherever necessary
As a Company we might get the requirent that we can hire some third party Engineer to resolve the issue.
Here he willget the Temporary access until the work is done.
7.Allows us to set up our own password rotation policy.
Password should be case sensitive,Atleast contain one Capital Letter etc.
8.Intergrates with many different AWS Services 
9.Supports PCI DSS Compliance

Terms in IAM :
--------------
Users
Groups
Roles
Policies

Users : End user who is going to access the AWS Cloud console.
Groups : Collection of users under one set of permissions.
Roles : We can create Roles and assign them to AWS Resources.
Gropus can be assigned to the users where as Roles can be assigned to the services.
Policies : It is a document that defines one or more permissions.
what kind of permission that a specific User will have,Group will have,Role will have.
Policies i.e permission document can be attached to User,Group,Role.

Consider the scenario where in EC2 we will launch virtual servers and in S3 is a Storage.
If EC2 wants to communicate with S3 in a secured way,provide the Role to EC2.
