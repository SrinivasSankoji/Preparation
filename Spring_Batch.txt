1.Spring Batch Introduction :
*****************************
In Banking Batch Programming Being USed a Lot.
If The Customer Does the Credit Card Transaction and 
If He Opens the Account The The Transactional Details will Not Reflect Immediately.
It Takes Some Time To Reflect There Because These Transactional Details Being Saved or Stored in Some Other Application.
All Together Belongs to Different Systems.
Coming To Customer Account It Has Its Own Application and Its Own Databases.
In Order to Get the Data From Another Application to Customer Application There Will be a Batch Processing.
We Retrieve Some SMS,Mails Regarding Fee Due Date ,Holiday ,Results,Mark Sheet Generation etc By Using Batch Processing.
Any System That Does Not Communicate With Another System Database Directly and Even They Cannot Use Web Service Often
To Get the Data Form One Application to Another Application.
As This Data is Huge and Frequently Being Used Every Time We Cannot Get the Data From Another Place.
Here the Data Must be There in their Place So That They Can Perform Any Operations on that Data.
They Can Also Load The Data in the Cache Because This is One Time Activity.
Here Reports Get Generated Either at The End of The Day,Week or a Month.
All these Scenarios Will be Done By Using Batch Processing.
Batch Processing is Nothing But With Minimal Human Interception or Without Human Interception 
If Some Thin Happens Behind The Scenes is Called Batch Processing.

2.How Batch Programming Works :
*******************************
In Banking We Need Data From Source System to Target System.
Their Might Be Some Use Case Where We Have Some File.
Read File and Insert into DB.
We Also Need to Process the Data Before Saving it into the Database.
Here Processing is Called Transformation.
We Also get The Requirement To Read The Data From  Database and Write it to the File.
There Might Be Also the Requirement Where We Can Send Emails,SMS to the Users.
This is The Way Batch Programming Works.
We Can Achieve it By USing Unix Script,Python Script,Java Programming etc.

3.Spring Batch Features and Advantages :
****************************************
Spring Batch Provides Lot of In Built Features Compared to Another Batch Programming Technologies.
Here Developers Can Concentrate Only on Implementation Rather Than Infrastructure and Other Configuration Part.
We Need Not Worry About How To Read The File,How To Persist,How To Handle The Exception etc Will be Taken Care By Spring Batch.
Decoupling Between Different Layers i.e Spring Batch has Different Layers Readers,Writers,Processor,Listeners etc.
These are Independent and Out of The Application.
There is No Coupling Between Business Logic Code and Configuration Code.
Spring Batch Provides Separation Between Infrastructure and Application.
SpringBatch Provides 17 Item Readers and 15 Item Writer Implementations.
Spring Batch Provides Default In Built Reader Writer.
With Minimal Configuration We Can Add Any Custom Reader or Custom Writer.
In Traditional Batch Processing Approach,If Something Goes Wrong While Processing the Data,
Again We Have to Rerun Everything.
If We Have Millions of Records and AFter Some Time If Some Thing Goes Wrong 
and If We Run the Batch Again then There Will be Duplication.
Here The Business User Will Not allow to do this.
In Spring Batch There is A Facility to Restart the Job.
Here It Wont Process All the Records and Starts form the Failed Records.
Here Spring Batch has the Ability to Start/Stop/Restart Jobs and Maintain State Between Executions.
We Can Achieve this By Using Configuration.
Spring Batch has the Ability to Skip the Record By Using Some Configuration.
In Case of Traditional Approach We Need to Write the Logic and it is Very Coupled.
Spring Batch Can be Configured By Using XML or Annotation Based.
Spring Batch also Maintains Some Statistical Information about the Job in the Database.


4.SpringBatch Architecture :
****************************


12.FaultTolerance Using Skip Policy :
*************************************
Skip Policy is Very Important In Order to Deal With Huge Amount of Data.
Usually We Read The Data Form the File,Process It and Write it INto the Database.
There Might be a Situation Where We Process the Entire File and At the End of the File If Any Error Occurs
The Entire Job Will Fail Due To Some Exception Like Bad Record,Bad Processing Logic or We Forgot To Handle Some Exceptions etc.
Here the Entire Job Will Get Failed and We Can Ignore that By Using Skip Policy.
This is Fault Tolerance  Mechanism Can be Achieved By Using Skip Policy.
Spring Batch Has Provided One Interface and We Need To Override the Method shouldSkip().
Here We Need to Define Set of Rules.
While Reading the Record We Identify The Bad Record.
There May Be a Scenario Where We Get More Bad Records than Good Records,
In This Scenario We Can Define a Threshold to Identify the Failed Records and Make he Job Fail.
In Case of Spring Batch Failed dCOunt Starts With Zero.
