*********************************************************************
1.Introduction :
----------------
The More Communication Between Micro Services we Get in our System,The Harder to understand what's Going On.
Specifically When the Load Increases and Response Time becomes Slower than Expected.
To get a Better Understanding on What is Going on,We need to able to Trace the Request as it Passes through the Number of
CoOperating Micro Services and Measure the Processing Time in Each Micro Service that is Involved in Responding to the Request.
The Trace Event for One Request Must be Collected and Grouped Together and Presented in an Understandable Way.
This is What Exactly Zipkin About. 
Zipkin Originate from Twitter and become a Open Source Project in GitHub.
Spring Cloud Sleuth Can be Used in Micro Services that has been developed by Spring Cloud,Simplifies the Creation of Trace Events
and Sending them to Zipkin Server.

2.Trace Id and Span Id :
------------------------
Trace Represents the Whole processing Request.
Span Represents the Processing Time that Takes Part in Each Micro Service in Processing Request.
All Trace Events i.e Whole Processing Request Will share a Unique Trace Id and Each Individual Processing Step i.e Span 
will Give a Unique Span Id.

3.Spring Cloud Sleuth :
-----------------------
Spring Cloud Sleuth Intercepts Incoming Requests and Picks up the Trace id form the Incoming Request or Create a New Trace Id
If None Was Specified.
For OutGoing Request it Fills Out The Trace Id In the Outgoing Message.
Both Synchronous and Asynchronous Messages are Supported.
HTTP for Synchronous Request and Spring Cloud Stream Binder For Asynchronous Messages.
Spring Cloud Sleuth Also handles the Creation of Spans and Span Id and Sends them to the Zipkin Server.
If The Internal Processing Uses Multiple Threads i.e Hystrix Based Circuit Beaker then 
Spring Cloud Sleuth is Capable to Move Thread Local Information i.e The Trace Id Between Two Threads.
Spring Cloud Sleuth Interacts with Logging Framework Used in Each Micro Service and 
Adds the Trace ID and Span Id to Each Log Record.

4.Adding Zipkin Server :
------------------------
Setting Up Zipkin Server is Straight Forward and is Similar to Other Spring Cloud Servers.
Example Spring Cloud Config Server,Discovery Server etc.
Zipkin Server Runs as a Conventional Spring Boot Application.

Add the Annotation @EnableZipkinStreamServer to the Spring Boot Application then 
The Application Becomes the Zipkin Server.
Now the Application can be Able to Trace Events Synchronously over HTTP.
Receive Trace Events Asynchronously over Spring Cloud Stream.
Present a Web Base UI For Searching Trace Events Manually.
Present a Restful and J son Based API For Searching and Tracing the Events Pragmatically.
Store Trace Events in Memory.

It is Also Possible to Configure a Zipkin Server to store the Trace Events in Database Lile MySql and Elastic Search.

5.Sending Trace Events Using Spring Cloud Sleuth :
--------------------------------------------------
To Enable Our Micro Services to Send the Trace Events to the Zipkin Server Add the Below Dependencies.

Spring-Cloud-Starter-Sleuth
Spring_Cloud-Sleuth-Stream

These Dependencies Will Enable Micro Services to Stream Tracing Events Asynchronously to the Zipkin Server over Event Bus.
To Ensure We Send all the Trace Messages to Zipkin Server,Add the Below Configuration to the Common Config File i.e application.yml

spring.sleuth.sampler.percentage: 1.0

To Make It Possible For Spring Cloud Sleuth to add Tracing Headers to the Outgoing Request,It is Important that
RestTemplate is Injected and Not Created Directly.
