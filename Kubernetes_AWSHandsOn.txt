*************************************************************  3.Kube API Server  ***********************************************************************************

API Server is the primary componenet that we intercat with,in the Kubernetes.
When we run the kubectl command,we are actually intercating with API Serevr.
API Server exposes some API that the user can interact with.
we can also intercat with API server using curl Request.

Consider the scenario of creating a Pod and the Steps are 

create the yml file
apply

Here request goes to the API Server and creates the Pod object and updates the ETCD and shows the user that Pod object is created.
The Scheduler which is running in the Kubernetes Cluster continuously monitors the API Server for the New Objects.
Whenever Scheduler finds the new Pod object has created,It looks for the Node where the Pod has to be placed.

Scheduler comes with the information of the available Node and then transfers the information to the API Server.
API Server again updates the ETCD Node with the Node information.
API Server then sends the information to the kubelet which is running on the worker Node.
kubelet gets the Node information from the API Server and communicates with the Container Runtime to create the Pod.
Container Runtime actually creates the Pod and updates the kubelet and then kubelet then updates the API Server that the Pod has created.
API Server then updates the ETCD about the Pod creation.

ETCD is the place where we have complete information about the Cluster.

If we install the Kubernetes as Hardware,download the binary and provision the kube API Server.
If we install the Kubernetes using the kubeadm,kubadm actually runs the API Server as Pod.
When we switch to the console we can actually see how the API Server is running as Pod and we can see all the Configuration details.

To get all the Nodes in the Cluster,we use the command

	kubectl get nodes

To get all the Pods in the Cluster,we use the command

	kubectl get pods

Here no Pods are running as of now.
minikube actually uses the kubeadmin to deploy the Kubernetes cluster.
But we are not able to see all the Kubernetes Components as Pods because all these Pods are deployed in different Namespaces.
All these system Pods runs in a namespace called kube-system.

	kubectl get pods --namespace kube-system (or) kubectl get pods --n kube-system

If we are deploying Kubernetes as a Hardware,download the binary and run the kube API Server as a Service.
Configuration will be in the ETCD  and can view the Configuration in the ETCD service filename.
To see the configuration of the API Server Pod,we use the command

	kubectl describe pod kube-apiserver-minikube -n kube-system

If we want to see the response in Json format

	kubectl get pods -o json

*************************************************************  4.ETCD in Kubernetes  ******************************************************************************

ETCD is the single source of truth for all the components of the Kubernetes System.
ETCD actually stores everything that is happening in the Kubernetes Cluster i.e Pod Creation,Adding Node,Any Deployment etc.
When we do migration in Kubernetes,ETCD is the most importnat Component and If we loose the ETCD we actually loose the data.

ETCD is open source,distributed key value data store.
ETCD has consistent Read and Write i.e Any data which we write that is immideately for Read.
ETCD is highly available because data is replicated in all the Nodes.
when we deploy Kubernetes in a production Environment,we normally see the ETCD as external Component and not deployed along with the Kubernetes Cluster.
ETCD is a Cluster of its own.It can be a 3 Node or 5 Node Cluster and maintain a leadership among them using RAFT protocol.
ETCD is secure.

If we set up the Kubernetes cluster from scratch,we can isolate ETCD cluster by creating as a seperate Cluster of its own.
Then advertise the address to the Kubernetes Cluster.
If we set up the Kubernetes cluster using kubeadm,kubeadm deploys all of them as Pods.

To see all the Pods in the Kubernetes system,we use the command

	kubectl get pods --n kube-system

To see all the COnfigurations in the ETCD Pod we use the command

	kubectl describe pod etcd-minikube -n kube-system

If we run the ETCD as binary or external cluster then we will be able to see the ETCD as Service and runs on port 2379.
All the configuration information will go inside the system d service file.

To intercat with ETCD Cluster or ETCD Node which is deployed by the minikube local system

	kubectl exec etcd-minikube -n kube-system -- sh -c "ETCDCTL_API=3 etcdctl --endpoints https// --cacert --key --cert get / -prefix --keys-only"

To insert the data into the ETCD

	kubectl exec etcd-minikube -n kube-system -- sh -c "ETCDCTL_API=3 etcdctl --endpoints https// --cacert --key --cert put name bhaumik"

	kubectl exec etcd-minikube -n kube-system -- sh -c "ETCDCTL_API=3 etcdctl --endpoints https// --cacert --key --cert get name"


************************************************************* 6.Kube Controller Manager and Scheduler  ************************************************************

Controller Manager :
--------------------
Controller Manager is another component of Kubernetes echo system that manages the Operational work.
Controller Manager is not a single component and a group of smaller components packaged as a Single Binary.

If we set up the Kubernetes cluster from scratch,download the binary from Kubernetes Release Pages and run it as Service.
If we set up the Kubernetes cluster using kubeadm then ControllerManager will be running as Pod.

we have different Controller in the Controller Manager.

Replication Controller ensures the number of Pods are running as per the Configuration.
Replication Controller keeps monitoring the API Server fro any changes.
When particular Pod goes down,kubelet shares the information to the API Server which then shares the information to the ETCD.
Controller Manager gets the information about the Pod from the API Server and 
If the Pod is down then the Controlle Manager tries to restart another Pod in the same Node or another Node.

Scheduler :
-----------
Scheduler is another Component of Kubernetes eco system.
Whenever we create a Pod obejct for deployment,Scheduler finds the appropriate Worker Node where the Pod has to placed.

Scheduler has two stages which can be used to deploy the Pod in a correct Node.
Filtering
Scoring

Consider the scenario we have 4 Worker Nodes.

Woker Node 1  : 1 GB
Woker Node 2  : 500 MB
Woker Node 3  : 10 GB
Woker Node 4  : 20 GB

If we want to deploy a Pod which requires 2GB of Memory.
Here Scheduler filters all the worker Nodes and  gets the suitable Nodes.
Scheduler then scores the Nodes based on the available resources and places the Pod into the Node which has the highest score.
