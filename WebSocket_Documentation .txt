Web sockets are defined as a two way communication between the server and client over a single TCP Connection.
i.e both parties communicate with each other and exchange data at the same time.

Web socket provides a full duplex communication from the ground.

web socket works on the principle of HandShake and
it is a process that ensures that server is in sync with its clients.

Key points are true concurrency and optimization of Performance resulting in more responsive and
rich web applications. 

Web socket protocol is standardized and  a 
web application can speed up with the help of this Protocol Technology.

The Only requirement to use the web socket is , on the browser side we need to run a javascript library 
that interrupts the web socket handshake , establish and maintain the web socket connection.

Websocket first establishes a regular HTTP connection to the server  ant then converts it to a biderectional 
web socket connection by sending an Upgrade Header.

WebSocket Configuration :

The First Step is to configure the WebSocket EndPoint and Message Broker.
@EnableWebSocketMessageBroker is used to enable our Web Socket Server and we need to implement 
WebSocketMessageBrokerConfigurer Interface.

First We Need to register a websocket EndPoint that the client will use to Conneect to our WebSocket Server.
Second We Need to Configure a Messaging Broker that will be used to route Messages from One Client To Another.

WebSocket is A communication protocol and it does not define things like 
How to Send a Message Only to Users who are subscribed to a Particular Topic,
How to Send a Message to a Particular User.
Here we Need STOMP(Simple Text Oriented Messaging Protocol).

STOMP is a Messaging Protocol that defines the rules and format for data Exchange.
