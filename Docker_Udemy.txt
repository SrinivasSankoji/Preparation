******************************************************  1.Introduction  ***********************************************************************

2.Overview :
------------
To set up an end to end Application Stack including various Technologies Like 
Web Server using Node JS
Database Using Mongo DB
Messaging System like Redis
Orchestration tool Like Ansible.

There might be lot of Issues while developing the Application Stack.
One of them is Compatibility with the Underlying OS.
we have to make sure all of these technologies are Compatible with OS Version.
We also neeed to check the Compatibility with Libraries and dependencies with the Underlying OS.
This Compatibility Metric Issue is usually referred to as Metric Hell.

Everytime a New Developer is OnBoarded we found lot of Issues in setting up the Environment.
New Developer has to follow large set of Instructions and remember Hundred's of Command to set up the Environment.
They have to make sure that they are using the Right OS,Right Version of each of these Components.
Each Developer has to set the Environment for each Time.
We also have different Development Environments.
Different Developers may use Different OS.
We may not Gaurantee that the Application run on One OS will run on another OS.
All of these i.e developing,building and shipping the Application become more Difficult.
we need something to sort out the Compatibility issue,allow us to modify the components without effecting the Other Components,
even modify the Underlying OS if required.

With Docker we can be able to run Each Component in a Seperate Container with its own dependencies and its own Libraries
all on the same OS and VM but within the Seperate Containers.
We just had to build the Docker Configuration Once and all the Developers could get Started with Simple Docker run Command.
Irrespective of what the Underlying Operating System they have,they just need the Docker installed on the System.


Containers :
------------
Containers are Completedly isolated Environments,they can have their own Processors,Services,Networking Interfaces ,Own Mounts
just Like Virtual Machines except they all share the Same OS Kernel.
Docker utilizes LXE Containers.

Setting up the Container is very hard and it is very LowLevel.
Docker Offers a High Level tool with several powerful functionalities making it really easy to create the Container.

Any Operating System Consists of two things.

1.OS Kernel
2.Software

OS Kernel is responsible for interacting with underlying Hardware and the Software makes the Operating System Different.
This Software may Consists of Different User Interfaces, drivers,Compilers,File Managers,Developer tools etc.
We have Common Linux Kernel Shared across all OS and some software that differentiates the OS.

Docker Containers share the Underlying Kernel.
Consider the Case we have an ubuntu System that have docker installed on it.
Docker can run any flavor of OS on top of it as long as they are on the Same Kernel and in this case Linux.

If the Underlying OS is ubuntu,Docker can run a Container based on another distribution of ubuntu.
Here each Docker Container only  has Additional Software that makes the Operating System different and
Docker utilizes the Underlying Kernel of the Docker Host which works with all OS above.

The OS do not share the same kernel is Windows.
we wont be able to run a windows based Container on a Docker host with Linux on it.
For that we require a Docker on a Windows Server.

When we install Docker Container on windows and run a container based on Linux.
when we install docker on windows and run a Linux Container on windows, we are not really running a Linux Container on windows.
Windows run a Linux Container on a Linux Virtual Machine under the hood.

Docker is not meant to virtualize and run different OS kernels on the Same Hardware.
The Main purpose of Docker is to package and containerize the Application and ship them so that it can be run any where anytime as many times we want.

In case of Docker we have underlying Hardware Infrastructure ,OS and then Docker is installed on the OS.
Docker manages the Containers that runs with the Libraries and Dependencies.
In case of Virtual Machine we have Hypervisor on the hardware and the Virtual Machine runs on them.
Each virtual Machine has its own OS,Libraries,Dependencies and then the Application.

Virtual Machine consumes the Higher disksapce where as Docker Container consumes MegaBytes.
This makes the Docker Container to boot up Faster where as VM will takes minutes to boot up.

There are lots of Containerized version of Applicationn readily today.
Most Organizations containerized their Applications today and made them Publicly Available on Docker Hub.
Example :

		docker run mongodb 

runs the mongodb database on the docker Host.
We can also run the Multiple Instances of the Web Service and configure a Load Balancer in the Front.
In case if one of the Instance is Failed,Simply destroy the Insatnce and launch any one.

Docker image is a package or Template just like a VM Template and is used to create on ore More Containers.
Containers are running Instances of images that are isolated and have their own Environment and set of Process.
We can also create our own image and push it into DockerHub and available for public.

Traditionalyy Developer develop the Application and give it to the Operations for Deployment in Production.
Developer do this by Providing the Set of Instructions.
Since the Operations Team does not have any Idea of the Application they Struggle while Deploying the Application.
In case of Deocker Developer provide the Application along with the Docker File to the Operations Team.
This Docker File is used to create an Image to the Application and run on any environmet with Docker installed on it.


3.Getting Started with Docker :
-------------------------------
Docker has two Editions i.e community Edition and Enterprise Edition.
Community is the set of free Docker Products.
Enterprise edition is the certified and supported container platform that comes with enterprise add ons like Image Management ,Image Security,
Universal control on managing container Orhestrations.
Community edition is available on Linux,Mac,Windows and Cloud Platfrom like AWS.

4.Note on Installing Docker :
-----------------------------
Recommended Guide Lines.

5.Demo Setup and Install Docker :
---------------------------------
Docker desktop for Windows.


******************************************************  2.Docker Commands  **********************************************************************

1.Basic Docker Commands :
*************************

1.docker run :
--------------
docker run command is used to run a docker container from a Image.

	docker run nginix
	
will run the instance of the nginix application on the docker host if it is already exists otherwise it will download the image from the Docker Hub.
This is done only for the first time and for the sub sequent times it will reuse the same image.


2.docker ps :
-------------
	docker ps 

command will list all the  running containers and gives basic information about the container.

3.docker ps -a :
----------------
This will give information about all the running and exited Containers.

4.docker stop :
---------------
To Stop a running Container we use the command 

	docker stop containerId or containerName

by giving either container id or name.
To get the docker container name or id we use the command 

	docker ps 

5.docker rm :
-------------
If we don't want the container to consume space and want to get rid of it.
we use the 

	docker rm

command to remove the stopped or exited container permanently.
what if the image is downloaded and not used on the docker host.
we see the list of images and their information using the command 

	docker images
	
6.docker rmi :
--------------
To remove an image that is no longer used we use the command
	
	docker rmi imageName
	
Here we must ensure that no container is running for that image.
we must stop all the dependent containers to be able to delete the image.


7.docker pull :
---------------
If we want to download the image we use the command 

	docker pull ubuntu
	
It pulls only the image and won't run the Container.
If we run the ubuntu image after the pull command it runs the image and exits immideately.
Because Containers are not meant to host Operating System like Virtual Machine.
Containers are meant to run a specific task or process such as instance of a web server,application server,database,computation or analysis task etc.
Once the Task is Complete then the Container exits.
Container lives as long as the the process inside the container lives.
If the webserver inside the container stops or crash then the Container exits.
This is why the ubuntu image stops the execution because there is no process or application running in it.

If the image is not running any service we can instruct the docker to run command with the process.

	docker run ubuntu sleep 10
	
when the conatiner starts it runs the sleep command and sleeps into 10 seconds.
when the sleep command executes then the container stops.

8.docker exec :
---------------
If we want to execute a command on the running container 

	docker exec containername cat /etc/hosts
	
9.docker attach :
-----------------
when we run the simple web application using docker i.e

	docker run kodekloud/simple-webapp
	
It runs the application in the attached mode.
output of the web application is seen on the standard console.
we wont be able to do other things untill the docker container stops.
Web application won't respond to our inputs.

CTRL+C to stop the application hosted on the container and the container exits.

10.docker detach :
------------------
To run the application on the detached mode 

	docker run -d kodekloud/simple-webapp
	
This will run the application in the background mode and will be back to the prompt immideately.
run the 

	docker ps 
	
command to view the running container.
Now if we want to attach the application back to the running conatiner we use the command 

	docker attach imageId
	
Here imageId can be thr first five characters of the container Id.


2.Demo Docker Commands :
************************

	docker run hello-world
	
First it will Check whether the Image is present or not.If not Present then it will pull from the Docker Hub.

	docker ps 
	
It will display the list of running Containers only.

	docker ps -a 
	
It will display the list of containers that are executed in the past and exited.
If we want to create our own image,then the naming convention would be
	
	srinivas/movie-info-service

	docker run centos
	
Here it run the Image and it does not do anything.
centos is a base image for centos Operating System.
Docker is used to run services and applications.
If we want to keep the container alive we need to run something i.e run the services inside the container.

	docker run -it centos bash
	
Here when we run the image,open the container in bash mode.
To check the Operating System of centos 

	/etc/*release*
	
Run the centos imaage and sleep for 20 Seconds and after that it exits.

	docker run centos sleep 20
	
Run the centos imaage and sleep for 2000 Seconds in the background and after that it exits.

	docker run -d centos sleep 20
	
When we run a container and it exits,container lives on the disk drive.
If we want to kill the Container we use the command 

	docker kill containerName
	
When we close the container forcefully, then the exit code will be 137 otherwise it will be 0(exited under normal Conditions).
If we want to remove the Containers that were run in the past and exited,we use the command 

	docker rm containerId
	
If we want to remove multiple containers 

	docker rm containerId containerId containerId
	
This is the way to reclaim the Disk Space.
To see the List of images 

	docker images

To remove the image,we use the command

	docker rmi imageName

Before deleting the image check whether any container is running for that image.delete the container and remove the image.
If we dont want the docker to run the image immideately and only need to pull we use the command
	
	docker pull ubuntu

If we want to run the command on the particular Container and see the files inside the container

	docker exec containerId cat /etc/*release*
	

******************************************************  3.Docker Run     *************************************************************************

1.Docker Run :
**************
		
	docker run redis 
	
This will run the container containing a Redis Service.By default it will pull and run the latest image.
Here it will run the latest image.
If we want to run the older image we use the version number followed by :

	docker run redis:5.0

when we run the docker image for standard input,it will not ask for the prompt and prints whatever the application is supposed to.

	docker run kodekloud/simple-prompt-docker
	
By Defaulr Docker Container does not listen to a standard input.
Eventhough it is attached to the console,it will not read any input from us.
It does not have a Terminal to read inputs from.
Docker Container runs in a Non Interactive Mode.

If we like to provide the input, we must map the standard input of the host to the docker container by using i parameter.
i stands for interactive mode.

	docker run -i kodekloud/simple-prompt-docker
	
Here Still the prompt is missing.to get the prompt in the docker terminal we use -t.

	docker run -it kodekloud/simple-prompt-docker
	
2.Port Mapping :
----------------
run the simple web application on the docker host.

	docker run kodekloud/webapp
	
underlying host where the docker is installed is called Docker Host or Docker Engine.
When we run a containerized web application,it runs and we are able to see the server is running.

Question is How does the user access the application ?
Here the Application listens to the port 5000 and can be accessed by using port 5000.

What Ip should be used to access the application from the web browser ?
There are two options available

1.IP of Docker Container
Every docker container gets the ip default.
But this is an internal ip and is only accessible within the docker host.
If we open the browser within the docker host and enter ip and port to access an application.

If we want to access the application outside we need to use the docker Host Ip.
For this to work we must map the port inside the docker container to a free port on the docker host.
For example If we want to access the application through port 80 on docker host,
map the port 80 on Docker host to the port 5000 of the docker container.

	docker run -p 80:5000 kodekloud/simple-webapp
	
All traffic on port 80 will be routed to port 5000 inside the docker container.
This way we can run multiple instances of the application and map them to different port on the docker host.

we can also run different instances of different applications in different ports.
we cannot map to the same port on the docker host more than once.

3.Volume Mapping :
------------------
How the data is persisted inside the Docker Container ?

Consider the case where we run the mySql Container.

	docker run mysql

when the databases and tables are created,data files are stored in the location /var/lib/mysql inside the docker container.
Docker container has its own isolated file system and any change to any files is happened within the container.

Consider the case we have dumped lot of data to the database.
If we want to delete the mysql container,the container and all its data is removed.

If we want to persist the data, we have to map the directory outside the container of the docker host to inside the container of the docker host.

	docker run -v /opt/datadir:/var/lib/mysql mysql 
	
If we want to see the additional details about the specific container 

	docker inspect containerName
	
It returns all the details of the container in a Json Format.

4.Container Logs :
------------------
If we want to see the logs of the container 

	docker logs containerId/containerName
