Docker Commands and Docker Files are particularly suitable for creating individual containers.
But If we want to operate on a Network of isolated Applications,Container Management quickly becomes cluttered.

To solve that Docker provides a tool named Docker Compose.
Docker Compose comes with its own build file in YAML format and is better suitable for managing Multiple Containers.
We can start or stop composite of Services in one command or we can merge the logs of multiple services together into one pseudo-tty.
