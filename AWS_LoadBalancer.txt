1.What is Load Balancer :
-------------------------
Load Balancer accepts incoming Network traffic from Client 
and based on some criteria in the traffic it distributes the communication to one or more back end servers.
Load Balancer plays an important role in building great internet Applications.
Load Balancer provides the benefits of Redundancy and scalability.

Redundancy :
As long as there is one Application Server,Load Balancer accepts the incoming request from the client and redirects to the Application Server.

Scalability :
By running 2 Servers behind a Load Balancer we can now handle 2X requests from the client.
Load Balancers provides a way to add more and more Backend Servers if the incoming network traffic increases.
