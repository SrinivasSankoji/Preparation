SOAP Service Installation




********************************************************  1.Introduction to SOAP Web Services : ********************************************************

There are two types of Web Services SOAP and REST.
For SOAP the Specification is JAX-WS and for Rest the Specification is JAX-RS.
Web Service is nothing but a Service that is made available to the network and is accessible over the network.
Social Media Applications,Ecommerce Applications are nothing but Web Sites.
Web Sites are used for Human Consumption where as Web Service are used for Code Consumption or Application Level Consumption.

For Example we have written a Service for getting List of Products and deployed on to the Application Server.
All the other Services which are deployed in the same Application Server are free to call the Products List Service.
If Other user which runs on different Application Server wants to access the Products List Service.
To do that Products List Service code has to be converted into Jar and deploy in the other user Application Server.
The Second disadvantage is If there is any change in the Product List then the Other user has to redeploy the Jar in his Application Server.
The ideal Solution is other user has to directly call the Product List which is deployed on Other Application Server.
In this Case Product List always has the Updated Data.
By using Web Services Two different Applications which are running on two different servers can communicate with each Other.
The other Advantage of using Web Service is that It uses a Standard Technology and not specific to any Language.
By using Web Service we achieve inter operability i.e Java piece of code can be accessed by using .Net piece of code.
By Using Web Service we can choose different Technologies to implement Business Service and expose it as a Web Service.


******************************************************** 2.Web Services Jargon : ************************************************************************
JAX-WS :
--------
JAX-WS stands for Java API for XML and Web Sevices.
JAX-WS is XML based Java API to build web services Server and Client Application.
JAX-WS is part of Java Standard API and no need to include any thing else while working with it.

WSDL :
------
I have implemented Java Service and want to share the implementation to the other developers of the Project.
The best way to share the implementation Class details is by using Interface.
Any Consumer consumes the service implementation by using Interface.
Consumer knows what are the arguments of the Service,Method Name and return type of the Service implementation by using Interface.
An Interface is a standard way to share the Service details to the Consumer.
In case of Web Service how we can share the details to the Consumer ?
Here Interface wont work because we don't know which technology the Consumer is using.
Here the Service details that has to be shared with the consumer should be Technology Independent.
Standard format to share the details about the Web Service to the Consumer is XML and is Called WSDL(Web Service Description Language or Web Service Definition Language).
WSDL contains contract to the Web Service.
When we create the Web Service create the WSDL document for that Web Service and share it to the Consumer.
There are tools that generates the WSDL for the Web Service.
Here contents of the Web Service are similar to interface i.e Methods,Arguments and Return Type.

UDDI (Universal Discovery Description and Integration) :
--------------------------------------------------------
For Example we have a Client Application that has to call the Web Service.
One way to get the information about Web Service is WSDL.How do we get hold of the WSDL ?
There are directories of the Web Services where we can query and get the Web Service ie UDDI.
UDDI is a registry where we can register the Web Services and make them available to the Client Applications.

SOAP :
------
Now the Client got the WSDL Document and has to call the Web Service.
For example the Client Code is written in Java Language and the Web Service accepts String parameter that is written in C++.
Here Java String can be different from C++ String.
Here exchange of Information should be done irrespective of Technology i.e XML.
This exchange is nothing but protocol and is called SOAP.
SOAP is a protocol in which different applications can access Data. 

SEI (Service EndPoint Interface) :
----------------------------------
Here Java Object is converted into SOAP Message and is done by SEI ie
We have an interface at Client Application to the Web Service End Point which translates the Web Service call into SOAP Message so that WS End Point can understand the Request.
The inetreface is nothing but Service EndPoint Intrerface.

SEI can be generated Automatically for us.

When we are making a Web Service call we don't need to worry about where the Web Service is and where we need to Call.
All we need to have is Service End Point is getting generated and then call the Method of the Service End Point Interface.
The good thing about Service End Point Interface is that we can have an SEI interface specific to what we are developing.
If we are developing Java Application we can have Service End Point related to Java and It knows how to convert Java Object into SOAP Message.
SEI can be generated out of WSDL.

******************************************************** 3.Stub Generation *********************************************************************************

Here we are going to write the Java Application that consumes the Web Service i.e We are writing the Web Service Client.
There are few Web Services that are free for Online

http://www.webservicex.net/geoipservice.asmx?WSDL

Create a Java Project that locates the country based on IP.
In case of normal Java Application we have an Interface and we call the method of that Interface to get the country based on IP.
Since we are calling a remote Web Service we need to have a SEI to call the Web Service.
To call the Web Service Stub has to be generated locally and based on Stub we call the Web Service.
We generate the Stub using the Java Tools and Stub internally calls the Web Service.
Copy the Source Code that is getting generate form the WSDL and paste it into the project structure.

Use the Command wsimport WSDL(File Name)

******************************************************** 4.Calling the Service : ****************************************************************************







******************************************************** 9.Service First and Contract First Web Services : ***********************************************

We can create SOAP web Services in RPC Style and Document Style and the difference is the way WSDL file is getting generated.
By adding @WebServie and @SOAPBinding we are making the Service as Web Service and this is a Simple Scenario.
There will be scenarios where @WebService and @SOAPBinding will not be enough.

Do we write Interface first or implementation first ?
Most of the times we write an interface first and then we write the Implementation.						
The reason behind this is we can change the implementation and even If the business logic changes interface remains same.
Interface in Web Service Technology is WSDL.
Client Code refers to the WSDL to find out what the Web Service is providing.i.e what are the input parameters,return type and method name.
We need to lock the WSDL because it will be called by many clients and there will not be any impact.
We can change the implementation based on requirement.

Whenever we are using @WebService to the implementation class,WSDL is getting generated fromm the Implementation.
This Scenario is called Service First.
If I change the parameters of implementation Class then WSDL also impacted Here.
Here the problem is WSDL is not locked.

Here the solution is write the WSDL first and generate the implementation from the WSDL.
This scenarios is called contract first.


********************************************************  10.Understanding WSDL :  ************************************************************************

 
 


******************************************************** 21.SOAP Web Service using JAX-WS   ***************************************************************


 
******************************************************** 24.Spring Boot SOAP Webservice Example (howtodoinjava) *******************************************

Here we will be implementing a simple Contract First SOAP Web Service.

Step 1 :
--------
Copy the XSD File into Resources Folder

Step 2 :
--------
Add JAXB maven plugin for XSD to Java object generation
We will be using jaxb2-maven-plugIn to generate the domain classes efficiently.
The PlugIn uses XJC tool as Code generation engine.
XJC compiles an XML Schema file into fully Annotated Java Classes.  

Step 3 :
--------
Create the Data Repository.Here we wiil be hard coding the Data.

Step 4 :
--------
Create the Web Service End Point.
The Annotation that can be used while developing the Web Service End Point are

@EndPoint
@PayloadRoot
@RequestPayload
@ResponsePayload

@EndPoint :
-----------
@EndPoint registers the class with Spring Web Service as a Web Service that can be used for processing the incoming SOAP Messages.

@PayloadRoot :
--------------
@PayloadRoot is used by the Spring Web Service to pick the handler method based on Message's Namespace and Local Part.

@RequestPayload :
-----------------
@RequestPayload maps the incoming message with the Method's request parameter.

@ResponsePayload :
------------------
@ResponsePayload maps the return value to the Response Payload.

Step 5 :
--------
Add SOAP Web Service Configuration Beans
Create a Configuration class to hold the Bean Definitions

The Configuration Class extends WsConfigurerAdapter which configures annotation driven Spring Web Service Programming Model.

MessageDispatcherServlet can be used for handling SOAP Requests.
We need to inject ApplicationContext to the MessageDispatcherServlet so that Spring Web Service can find other Servlets.
MessageDispatcherServlet can also be used to declare the URL Mapping for the Requests.
The Configuration also uses the transformed WSDL Location ie servlet.setTransformWsdlLocations(true).
If we see the exported WSDL then we have the local Addrees.
Similarly If we see the WSDL using the public facing IPAddress then we see the IPAddress instead of Localhost.
So the  EndPoint URL will be dynamic based on the deployment Environment

	@Bean
    public ServletRegistrationBean messageDispatcherServlet(ApplicationContext applicationContext) 
    {
        MessageDispatcherServlet servlet = new MessageDispatcherServlet();
        servlet.setApplicationContext(applicationContext);
        servlet.setTransformWsdlLocations(true);
        return new ServletRegistrationBean(servlet, "/service/*");
    }

DefaultWsdl11Definition exposes a Standard WSDL 1.1 using XSD Schema.
The bean Name StudentDetails will be the WSDL Name and It will be exposed under http://localhost:8080/service/studentDetails.wsdl/
This is the simple approach to expose the Contract First WSDL in Spring.

	@Bean(name = "studentDetailsWsdl")
    public DefaultWsdl11Definition defaultWsdl11Definition(XsdSchema countriesSchema) 
    {
        DefaultWsdl11Definition wsdl11Definition = new DefaultWsdl11Definition();
        wsdl11Definition.setPortTypeName("StudentDetailsPort");
        wsdl11Definition.setLocationUri("/service/student-details");
        wsdl11Definition.setTargetNamespace("http://www.howtodoinjava.com/xml/school");
        wsdl11Definition.setSchema(countriesSchema);
        return wsdl11Definition;
    }
	
	@Bean
    public XsdSchema countriesSchema() 
    {
        return new SimpleXsdSchema(new ClassPathResource("school.xsd"));
    }


******************************************************** 25.Spring Boot SOAP Client â€“ WebServiceTemplate (howtodoinjava) *****************************************************

Before running SOAP Client we need to have one SOAP Service ready which will invoke from the Client Code.
Once we run the SOAP Service we get the WSDL from the project.
Download the WSDL and copy it into the resources Folder.

Step 1 :
--------
Generate the SOAP Domain Classes ie
maven-jaxb2-plugIn can be used to generate the JAXB Annotated Stub Classes.
Here PlugIn will generate the Classes in the specified directory.
PlugIn will check the generated Timestamp of the Classes so that classes are generated only when there is a change in WSDL.

Step 2 :
--------
Create a SOAP Client with WebServiceTemplate.
Create a SOAP Connector class that extends WebServiceGatewaySupport which will act as a generic Web Service Client for all the requests to the Web Service.

Step 3 :
--------
Spring Bean Configuration
Create the Configuration Class which will have the required Bean Definitions required for the SOAP Connector to work properly.
WebServiceGatewaySupport requires Marshaller and UnMarshaller which are instances of Jaxb2Marshaller Class.
Jaxb2Marshaller cna be used to Marshaller/UnMarshaller of the SOAP Connector Bean.
