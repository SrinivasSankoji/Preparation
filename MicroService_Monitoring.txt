Centralized Logging
Use ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) or EFK Stack (Elasticsearch, Fluentd, Kibana) for centralized logging.
Collect logs from all microservices and the API Gateway to a central location for easier monitoring and debugging.
Example: Fluentd configuration:

Install Fluentd in your Kubernetes cluster.
Configure Fluentd to collect logs from applications and forward them to Elasticsearch.
Distributed Tracing
Use tools like Jaeger or Zipkin to implement distributed tracing, which helps trace requests as they propagate through different microservices.
Integrate with OpenTracing APIs to standardize tracing.
