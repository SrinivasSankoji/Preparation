************************************************************* 1.Views ************************************************************** 

View is a Database Object which is created over SQL Query.
View just represnts the data that is returned by the SQL Query.
View does not store any Data and executes the underlying Query.

View is similar to a Table and can be seen as virtual Table.
Difference between View and Table is that a Table can store data where as View doesnot store any data.
Every time we call the View it ineternally executes the underlying SQL query.

If we are sharing the query to the Client or third party, we are sharing the Database information to the them which is not recomended.
The solution is to create a view and share the View.
To create a View we use the command

	create or replace view order_summary
	as
	"Some select statements";
	
View only stores the structure of the View.
Execution of the View and SQL Query is the same.
View dosenot improove any performance.If we call the View 100 times it will execute the Query 100 times.

Advantages of Views :
---------------------
1.Security
2.Simplify Complex SQL Queries

If we share the View Client should be able to see the Structure of the View.
But in reality we do not share any Database credentials to the Client or Third party Vendors.
Here we will create the User and that User has specific rights.
By hiding the Queries used to generate the View.

Sharing a View is better than sharing the Complex Query.

Create and Modify a View :
--------------------------
If we use only create command to create the View It will give an Error.
replace command will check whether the view is present or not.If the View is present it will replace the View or else It will create the View.

If we use create or replace command to create the View, We cannot change the 
Order of the Column
Column Data Type
Column

Note :
------
View Query cannot have Distinct clause.
View Query cannot have Group By Clause.
View Query cannot have WITH Clause.
View Query cannot have WINDOW Functions.
