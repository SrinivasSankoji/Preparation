******************************************  1.Webhook with Spring Boot and H2 Database (dreamix) **********************************************

What exactly is a webhook :
---------------------------
Webhook is one of the best ways for real time communication with an Application.
Webhook delivers data to the Applications i.e it gets the data immideately when it occurs in an Application.
This makes much more efficient for both provider and consumer.
In webhook we have to register URL's which it will target an Application when the information is being streamed.
Webhook makes a Simple HttpRequest to an Application.

Where it is appropriate to use WebHook :
----------------------------------------
Whenever we want to extend our core product with others custom processes which communicates with our business logic in real time.
Whenever we want to improove user experience and have an Application with an Asynchronous Architecture.

Security is one of the most important things you should consider while uisng Webhook.We require the URL to use Https.
Carefully consider the data we share.
Think about fallback mechanism in case of a problem with internet traffic.
If we don't have fallback Mechanism Webhook can't be used in critical business Operations.

Webhook is nothing but a Simple HTTP call back.
When some thing happens,HTTP POST Calls the register URL as a Simple Notification.
Webhook is the concept that in Web Applications when certain things happen then automatic registered URL is aclled by HTTP POST to notify users on the web Application
that requested data is changed and please review it.
