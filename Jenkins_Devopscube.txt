***************************************************** 1.Jenkins Core Features  ************************************************************

The core features of Jenkins are

1.Pipeline as a Code
2.Shared Libraries
3.Better UI and UX
4.Improovements in Security and PlugIns
5.GitOps With Jenkins X

1.Pipeline as a Code :
----------------------
Using Pipeline as a Code we can run paralell builds on a Single Job on different Slaves.
Also we can have a good programatic control over how and what each Jenkins Job should do.
Jenkinsfile is the best way to implement Pipeline as a Code.
There are two types of Pipeline as a Code.

Scripted Pipeline
Declarative Pipeline

It is recomended to use Declarative Pipeline for all kinds of CI/CD workflows as we have more control and customization over Pipelines.

2.Shared Libraries :
--------------------
Shared Library is a great way to reuse the Pipeline as a Code.
We can create the libraries of our CI/CD which can be referenced in our Pipeline Script.
The extended Shared Libary allows us to write custom Groovy Code for more Functionality.

Here is how the Shared Library Works 

1.The common Pipeline Shared Library Code is hosted on a version COntrol System like GitHub.
2.In Jenkins Global Configuration,Shared Library GitHub Repo needs to be configured.
This enables the access to Library for all the Jenkins Jobs.
3.In an Individual Jobs we just need to add an import statement to import the Shared Libraries and use it in Pipeline as a Code.
During Build time Libary files will be checked out.

5.GitOps With Jenkins X :
-------------------------
Jenkins X is a project from Jenkins for CI/CD on Kubernetes.
This project is entirely different from Jenkins.

******************************************************** 2.Jenkins Architecture  *************************************************************

Jenkins is a Open Source Java Application that can be used for CI/CD.
Jenkins has a huge community support and Ocean of PlugIns that can integrate with many Open Source and enterprise tools.

Jenkins is mostly used for the following
1.Continuous Integration for Application and Infrastructure Code.
2.Continuous Delivery to deploy the Application into different Environments using Pipeline as a Code.
3.Run batch operations using Jenkins Jobs.
4.Run adhoc operations like backups,cleanups,remote script execution,event triggers etc.

The key components in Jenkins are 

1.Jenkins Server (Master Node)
2.Jenkins Agent Nodes/Clouds
3.Jenkins Web Interface
