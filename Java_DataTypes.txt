Primitive data types are the data types that are pre defined in java programming language and named by reserved keyword. 
Memory allocate to the primitive data types are :

	byte - 8
	char - 16
	int - 32
	long - 64
	float - 32
	double - 64
	short - 16
	boolean -  1
	void - 0
	
When the smaller value is assigned to bigger data type then it is implicit type casting.

	int i=200;
	long l=i;
	
When the larger value is  assigned to a smaller data type then it is explicit type casting.

	float f= 234.235f;
	int i=(int)f;
	
AutoBoxing is the automatic conversion of primitive data types into corresponding Wrapper classes by Java Compiler.
Java Compiler applies Auto Boxing when a primitive data type is assigned to the variable of the corresponding Wrapper class or
Primitive data type is assigned as an argument to the method which expects an object of corresponding wrapper class.

	Integer.valueOf(i);
	
Auto Unboxing is the automatic conversion of an object of wrapper type to its corresponding primitive value by the Java Compiler.
Java Compiler applies Auto Unboxing when a wrapper Object is assigned to the variable of the corresponding primitive type.

	Integer wrappedInt = new Integer(200); 
	int primitiveInt = wrappedInt; //Unboxing through assignment

Float takes 4 bytes of Memory where as double takes 8 bytes of Memory.
Float is single precision floating point decimal number where as double is double precision decimal number.
Float can represent upto 7 digits accurately after decimal point where as double can represent upto 15 digits accurately after decimal point.
default value of boolean is false.
