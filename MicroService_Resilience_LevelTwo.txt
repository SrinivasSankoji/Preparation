1.Agenda and PreRequisites :
****************************
Understanding the challenges with the availability of Micro Services and making Micro Services Resilient and Fault Tolerance.

2.Fault Tolerance vs Resilience
********************************
What is Fault Tolerance :
-------------------------
In the given Micro Service,If there is a fault then what is the impact of the fault.
How much tolerance does the system has for the specific fault and is nothing but Fault Tolerance.

Example : If one Micro Service Application goes down, does the whole Application goes down ?
If one Micro Service goes down and has some way Of handling failures then we don't have any impact.

What is Resilient:
------------------
How many faults that a system can tolerate before it is back to its need is called Resilience.
A part of resilience is that how much can the system bounce back  from a fault.
If some thing goes down then some of the functionalities won't work and 
when it comes back there would be some mechanism to correct the system and that comes under resilience.

Both are very similar concepts but slight differences.
We can technically have a system which is very fault tolerant but not resilience but most of the times it goes together.

3.Recap of Micro Services Level One
************************************
Created 3 Services and made them as Eureka Client
Registered With Discovery Server(Spring Boot Application)

4.Calling an External API
**************************
Use MovieDB for Movie Information(Movie info Service) and for This make a external call to Service .
If more no Of external calls then more chances of failures.

5.What If Micro Service goes down
*********************************
Here the Micro Service is not resilient because we don't have single catch block.

							--> Movie Info Service   -->  Movie DB

Movie Catalog Service  --> 
			^
			|				--> Ratings Data Service
			|
Discovery Server 

The above scenario is not fault tolerant because If one micro service fails,entire application goes down.
Question is how do we make resilient ?
One of the problem with Micro Service is that if particular instance goes down,we don't want the entire Application to go down.
In this case we make multiple instances of Micro Service.
We don't have to do any thing this to work because we make the service as Eureka Client that registers with Eureka Server.
Eureka Server knows that for that particular Micro Service how many instances are running i.e. By using Load Balancing Technology called Ribbon.
If one Service goes down,Eureka Server will automatically point to another Micro Service.
There is a client side Load Balancing Technology called Ribbon and it does a Round Robin.
If it sees more than one instance of a Micro Service then it manages the load between other Micro Services.

6.What If Micro Services goes slow
***********************************
If a Micro Service is slow it is a much bigger problem.
In the above example we have made an external call from Movie Info Service to get Movie DB.
Movie Catalog Service is the client and from this service we are making the call to Movie Info Service and Ratings Data Service.
From the Movie Catalog Service we are calling other two Services.
If any API that depends on Movie Info Service will be slow because Movie DB Service is slow.but in this case other services will also be affected.
Because for each call to the API,It will create a Thread in the Thread Pool and it will be there in the Thread Pool until it returns the response.
If there are multiple calls to the slow API then number of waiting  Threads in the Thread Pool will increase. 
After some period no new Threads will be created to make the new API Calls. 

7.The problem with Threads
**************************
Let us Consider the Web Server and it process the request ad returns the response.
For each Request it creates a new Thread and executes the request,gives back the response and Thread is removed from the Web Server.
If the request comes in a faster way than processing the request,
At certain point of time no space will be available for the new Thread to create.
In this case entire Application will go down in case of Micro Services.

8.Possible Solution for Slow Micro Services
*******************************************
Possible solution for slow Micro Services are TimeOut.
Once the Micro Service is taking time then return back with an Error.
Once we send back the response,Thread form the Web Server will be removed.
The other solutions are to increase the size of the Tomcat Thread Pool.
In case of Web Application we have 100 of Users and if each user click on refresh button then it multiplies the number of requests.
At this Point of time Application goes down.
Increasing the Thread pool size is not the Long term solution.
With Time Out mechanism, we technically have solution for the problem of Micro Service being slow down.
It also allows the New Requests.
We are using Rest Template to make the API Call and we can also set the Time Out to The Rest Template.
This is one of the way to set the Time Out but not the preferred way.

9.Adding Timeout to Rest Template
*********************************
In Movie Catalog Application i.e. calling Movie Info Service and  Ratings Data Service,
Where we configured the Rest Template,create the HttpComponentsClientHttpRequestFactory and
set the Time Out to the setConnectTimeout() Method.

HttpComponentsClientHttpRequestFactory httpComponentsClientHttpRequestFactory=
				new HttpComponentsClientHttpRequestFactory();
		httpComponentsClientHttpRequestFactory.setConnectTimeout(3);	
		
Pass the HttpComponentsClientHttpRequestFactory to the Rest Template i.e 
return new RestTemplate(httpComponentsClientHttpRequestFactory);

10.We haven't solved the problem yet
************************************
If we have set the Timeout for 3 seconds then it is not the correct solution.
Here Thread is going to wait for 3 Seconds and once it receives the response then Thread will be removed from the Web Server.
If the response is not receive within 3 seconds, it will throw an Error and Thread will be removed from the Web Server.
If there is a request per second and the Time Out is 3 seconds After some time there is no space for new Threads in the Web Server.
Time Out will solve the problem as long as the number of request per second is less than Time Out duration.

11.Understanding The Circuit Breaker Pattern
*********************************************

						   /--> Movie Info Service   -->  Movie DB(Slow Service and External)
(Client Service)		  /
Movie Catalog Service  -- 
					  ^	 \
					   \  \---> Ratings Data Service
						\
						 ------ Discovery Server 

Here the Time Out Scenario Cannot Provide the Complete Solution.
Here The Movie Catalog Service has to be Little Smart i.e 
Movie Catalog Service is Sending So Many Requests(i.e To Movie Info and Ratings Data Service) and out of that Request Detect the Service which is getting slow Response.
Rather Than Sending the Request Continuously to the Slow Service,Stop Sending the Request to The Slow Service for a Particular Time.
After Some Period of Time Check the Slow Service has Recovered or Not.
Wait till the Service Recovers back to its Original State.	

When the Service is Slow 
1.Detect Something is Wrong i.e Micro Service Calling Another Micro Service has the Ability to Detect that Something is Wrong.
2.Take Temporary Steps to Avoid the Situation Getting Worse i.e If the Micro Service is Struggling and If we Send More Requests to that Service,It Will Effect the Entire Application.
3.deActivate The Problem Component so that it Does Not Effect DownStream Components i.e Stop Sending the Requests to the Service which is Slow.
The above 3 Steps are Common in Fault Tolerance Systems and is Called Circuit Breaker Pattern.
Technically We Can Apply Circuit Breaker to Every Micro Service Which is Calling Another Micro Service.

12.Circuit Breaker Parameters
*****************************
Now We have a Movie Catalog Service that has the Capability of Circuit Breaker.
When a Request Comes in to the Movie Catalog Service,It has to call the Movie Info Service and it internally Calls
Movie DB Service and returns the Response Back to the Movie Catalog Service.

Here We Have to Provide the Response to the Movie Catalog Service even in the Failure or Slowness of Other Services.
We Need to Have Mechanism that any Micro Service that Calls Another Micro Service 
which has Circuit Breaker to do some thing that It Cannot be Supposed to do(Return Response In Case of Time Out or Slow Service Scenarios).
Before knowing what to do when the Circuit Breaks ,we need to know when the Circuit Breaks.
Every Circuit Breaker needs to be Triggered by Something.
In Case of Electrical Circuit,Circuit Breaker is triggered by the Variance in the Amount of Power Supply.
There is Some Parameter Set in the Circuit Breaker and Amount of Power that Crosses the Parameter then it Breaks the Circuit.
Consider the Scenario to set the Parameters to Break the Circuit in Case of Micro Services :

				Web Server
	
Request   -->    Success    ---------->   Micro Service --> Calls Another Service  
Request   -->    Timeout	---------->   Micro Service --> Calls Another Service
Request   -->    Success	---------->   Micro Service --> Calls Another Service
Request   -->    Failure	---------->   Micro Service --> Calls Another Service
Request   -->    Success	---------->   Micro Service --> Calls Another Service
Request   -->    Failure	---------->   Micro Service --> Calls Another Service
Request   -->    Success	---------->   Micro Service --> Calls Another Service
Request   -->    Failure	---------->   Micro Service --> Calls Another Service


If the Second Request is Timed out,Immediately we Cannot break the Circuit because Timeout Can Happens and 
For one Timeout we Cannot break the Circuit.
Similar is the Case for One Failure.
At what Point we need to break the Circuit ?
At Any Point of Time,If Last 3 Request are Timed out the Break the Circuit is One Scenario.But Not Valid.
If we Have Alternate Success and Failures then there is No Chance of Breaking the Circuit.
The Logic that need to be Set to Break the Circuit has to be Smart Enough and that has to use the Bunch of Use Cases.

Standard Parameters to Break the Circuit :
1.Last N Requests to Consider for the Decision.
2.How Many of Those Should Fail.
3.Timeout Duration

When Does the Circuit Comes Back to Original State :
1.How Long after a Circuit Trip to Try Again i.e When does the Circuit Breaker look again at The Failed Micro Service and Give Some Time.

Examples But Cannot be Used in Production :
-------------------------------------------
Last N requests to Consider for the Decision. 5 Requests
How Many of those Should Fail  : 3 Requests
Timeout Duration : 2 Seconds
How Long to Wait : 10 Seconds

Request   -->    100ms      --> Success    ---------->   Micro Service --> Calls Another Service 
Request   -->    4  Seconds --> Failure    ---------->   Micro Service --> Calls Another Service 
Request   -->    300ms      --> Success    ---------->   Micro Service --> Calls Another Service 
Request   -->    5  Seconds --> Failure    ---------->   Micro Service --> Calls Another Service 
Request   -->    5  Seconds --> Failure    ---------->   Micro Service --> Calls Another Service 

Then It Breaks the Circuit and Sleep for 10 Seconds because it Meets the Condition of Last 3 Requests.
Even if the 6th Request takes 200ms, then also Circuit is Going to Break.
How do we get the Information that I want these Many Requests to Fail before I Break the Circuit.
It Depends on How Many Request are Coming In,How Frequently Request are Coming In,
How Bigger is the Thread pool and How Much Capacity an Application Server can Handle.

13.What to Do When Circuit Breaks
**********************************
What Causes Circuit to Trip.
We Have Well Defined Parameters,Well Defined Formula which informs This is the Point where the Circuit needs to Trip.
i.e not Going to Send any Calls to the Failure or Slow Service.
When the Requests are Continuously Coming to Movie Catalog Service and don't want to call the Failure Service.
How do we Handle the Requests  and the Answer is Fall Back Mechanism.
Here Movie Info Service is Slow because of Movie DB Service is Slow.
Now From the Movie Catalog Service,Stop Calling the Movie Info Service.
Something Else will be there when a Circuit Breaks instead of Doing the Things Usually.
Bunch of Things we Can do For Fall Back Mechanism.
1.Throw an Error i.e Some thing Fails,Not Calling the Micro Service Any More when the Requests are Coming in,Throw an Error.
2.Return a Fall Back Default Response :
3.Save Previous Response in the Cache and Use that ,When it is Possible and This is The Best Way.
Here We Many not Get The Valuable Information or Accurate Information But We get Sensible Response.

14.Circuit Breaker Benefits
****************************
We Want Circuit Breakers Because We Want Fail Fast.Instead of Micro Services Failing Later and Handling Them let them Fail Fast.
Fall Back Functionality
Automatic Recovery
In Case of Circuit Breaker Pattern we have to do the Following things.
1.When to Break the Circuit
2.What to Do When Circuit Breaks
3.When to Resume Requests

15.What is Hystrix
*******************
Hystrix is an Open Source Library Created by NetFlix.
Hystrix Implements Circuit Breaker Pattern.
We Need to give Only the Configuration Parameters to the Hystrix When the Circuit Breaks.
Hystrix works well with Spring Boot.
Another Popular Pattern Alternative to Circuit Breaker Pattern is Adaptive Fault Tolerance.
  
16.Adding Hystrix to Spring Boot
*********************************
Step 1:
-------
Add the Hystrix Maven Dependency to Spring Boot i.e 
Spring-cloud-starter-netflix-hystrix

Step 2:
-------
Add the Annotation @EnableCircuitBreaker to the Main Application Class.
By Adding this Our Application will get the Hystrix Features.

Step 3:
-------
From the Above Step We have added Hystrix Capabilities To the Application But It Does Nothing.
To get The Features of Hystrix Add the Annotation @HystrixCommand to the Methods That Needs Circuit Breakers.
Now It Breaks the Circuit when the Things Go Wrong.

Step 4:
-------
Configure the Hystrix Behavior i.e add the Parameters,Here Movie Catalog Service is the Place where we have to add the Hystrix Behavior.
Before Adding the Parameters What would be the Fall back Mechanism when the Circuit Breaks ?
Here @HystrixCommand Annotation Accepts an Argument and One Of Them is fallbackMethod()
Here FallbackMethod Should have the Hard coded Response In Case When the Circuit Breaks or get the Data From Cache.
Reduce the Possibility of an Error When the Fall back Method Executes.

Restart All The Applications and Test the Scenario.

17.How Does Hystrix Works
**************************
In Case of Our Application,If the Movie Info Service or Ratings Data Service Fails,
It will Call the Fall Back Method and Returns the Response.
We Have Added only the Annotation @HystrixCommand to call the Fall back Method in Case when API Fails.

Here we Have an API Class and Inside The Class we have a Method Annotated with @HystrxiCommand.
Hystrix will Create a Proxy For that Class and Some Body Calls the Method,Hystrix will give the Proxy Class Instead of Class.
Proxy Class Contains the Circuit Breaker Logic.
When Somebody Makes a Call Hystrix is Constantly Watching what the Method is returning Back.
If the Response is Success then it Passes the Original Response.
If Some thing Fails,Then it Calls the Fall back Method and Returns the Fall back Response.

18.Problem With Hystrix Proxy
******************************
The Circuit Breaker We have Implemented is not Accurate and this can be Better.
Here Movie Catalog Service calls the Rating Data Service and Movie Info Service and If Any one of those Service Fails
It will Call the Fall back Method.
Consider the Ratings Data Service is Fine and Movie Info Service is Slow and In this Case also it Will Break the Circuit and returns the Fall Back Response.
Here the Possible Solution will be If Movie Info Service Fails,It has to return its Fall Back Response and similar is the Case with Ratings Data Service.
We want to have More Granularity in case of Fall Back Mechanism i.e individual Fall Back for Each Service.
Where ever we calling With The Rest Template in MovieCatalogController,Make them as Private Methods and add the @HystrixCommand Annotation
to Enable the Hystrix Behavior and call the Fall Back Method In case of Failures.
In the Above Case It Will Not Call the Fall Back  Method in Case of Any Failures Because of Proxy Class.
Proxy Class is a Wrapper around the Instance of the API Class.
We have added the Fall Back Methods inside the Class.
Hystrix will execute the Fall Back Methods Only when the Call is from External API i.e Calling from an URL 
and in this case it  will Create the Proxy Class and Proxy Class Verifies the Response is Success or Failure and returns either
Success Response or Fall Back Response.
Hystrix does not have an Opportunity to intercept between two Methods.
The Only way to Implement Circuit Breaker is Take the Methods into Another Class and add the Features of Hystrix Behavior.

19.Refactoring For Granular FallBack
*************************************
Create the Separate Classes for Movie Info And Ratings Data and Annotate with @Service.
In Movie Catalog Controller,Auto wire the MovieCatalog and Ratings Data Classes.
Here We Simulate the Failure by Bringing the Service Down.
We can also do this by Timeout.

20.Configuring Hystrix Parameters
**********************************
Till Now we have set the Default Parameter in the @HystrixCommand Annotation.
We have Lot more Parameters to set in the @HystrixCommand Annotation.
We can add more Parameters in the commandProperties = {@HystrixProperty(name="",value=""),
													   @HystrixProperty(name="",value="")}


21.Hystrix DashBoard 
*********************
Hystrix Provides the feature i.e the Ability to display the data in the dashBoard commonly Refereed to as Hystrix DashBoard.
We Add a Bunch of Binaries to the Class Path and it Provides a Kind of Web Application with the display of What are the Different Circuit Breakers we have in the System,
What are the Circuits that are Open,Closed,The Number of Request that are Coming In,The Number of Time Outs that are Happening.
We get all these Information in the Form of Visual Format.
We Can set Up Hystrix DashBoard for a Single Application or We Can Set up a External Hystrix DashBoard for Multiple Micro Service Applications.
