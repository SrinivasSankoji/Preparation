******************************************************  1.Auto Scaling (Prabhu Rajendran) ******************************************************************

In the traditional world there are limited number of servers to handle the Application Load.
When the number of request increases,load on the server also increases which cause failures and latency in system.

AutoScaling is a service provided in AWS using which we can automatically scale up or scale down the EC2 instances
based on user defined profiles,schedulers and health checks.
AutoScaling helps us to ensure that we have correct number of EC2 instances available to handle the load of an Application.

Collection of EC2 instances is called Auto Scaling Groups.
Sepcify the minimum number of EC2 instances in each Auto Scaling Group and Auto Scaling Group ensures that never goes below the size.
Specify the maximum number of EC2 instances in each Auto Scaling Group and Auto Scaling Group ensures that never goes above the size.
Specify the desired capacity either at the creation time or later ans ensures that group has this many instances.
Specify the scaling policies so that Auto Scaling can launch or terminate instances based on Application Load.

Components in Auto Scaling :
----------------------------
Group
Configuration Templates
Scaling Options

Group :
Each Ec2 instances are organized into Groups so that they can be treated as logical units for the purpose of Auto Scaling and Management.
When we create a Group we need to specify the minimum,maximum and desired number of EC2 instances.

Configuration Templates :
Group uses the launch configuration or launch templates for its EC2 instances.
We can specify the information such as AMI ID,Instance Type,Security Groups,block device mapping etc.

Scaling Options :
We can configure scale based on occurence of specific conditions or on a schedule.

Auto Scaling Life Cycle :
-------------------------
EC2 instance in Auto Scaling Group has lify cycle that differs from other EC2 instances.
Life Cycle starts when Auto Scaling Group launches an EC2 instance and puts into service.
Life Cycle ends when Auto Scaling Group terminates the EC2 instance or Auto Scaling Group takes out the instance from service and terminates it.

Scale Out
Pending
In Service
Scale In

Scale Out :
When Scale Out event occurs,Auto Scaling Group launches the required number of EC2 instances using its launch configuration.

Pending :
These instances start in pending state.
When each instance is fully configured and passes EC2 health check,it is attached to Auto Scaling Group and enters the In Service State.
Now the instance is counted against the desired capacity of the Auto Scaling Group.

In Service :
Instance remains in In Service state untill one of the following state occurs.
Scale In Event
Put the Instance into a Stand By state and Instance in Stand By state is managed by Auto Scaling Group and not active part of Application.
Detach the instance from Auto Scaling Group
Instance is removed from Auto Scaling Group If the required number of Health Check fails.

Scale In :
When Scale In Event occurs Auto Scaling Group detaches one or more instances.
Auto Scaling Group uses its termination policy to determine which instances to terminate.

Note:
We create a corresponding scale in event for each scale out event that we create.

Attach an Instance :
--------------------
We can attach a running instance that meets certain criteria to our Auto Scaling Group.
After the instance is attached,It is managed as a part of Auto Scaling Group.

Detach an Instance :
--------------------
We can detach an instance from Auto Scaling Group.
After the instance is detached we can manage it seperately from Auto Scaling Group or attach it to different Auto Scaling Group.

Life Cycle Hook :
-----------------
We can add life cycle hook to our Auto Scaling Group so that we can perfrom custom actions when instances launch or terminate.
