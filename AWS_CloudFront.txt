A Content Delivery Network (CDN) is a distributed network of servers strategically located across various geographic locations. 
The primary purpose of a CDN is to deliver content to users more efficiently by reducing latency and load time. 
Content includes web pages, images, videos, and other static or dynamic files, .

CDN Works based on below concepts

Geographical Distribution :
---------------------------
CDNs distribute copies of your content to servers (known as edge servers) located closer to end users around the globe. 
When a user requests content, it is served from the nearest edge server instead of the origin server.

Caching :
--------- 
CDN edge servers cache content, which means they store a temporary copy of the files after the first request. 
This reduces the load on the origin server and speeds up subsequent requests from nearby users.

Load Balancing :
---------------- 
CDNs use load balancing to distribute incoming traffic across multiple servers to prevent any single server from being overwhelmed, ensuring high availability and reliability.

Security :
---------- 
Many CDNs offer security features such as DDoS protection, SSL/TLS encryption, and Web Application Firewalls (WAF) to safeguard content and prevent malicious attacks.
