############################################################### 1.ACID Properties ######################################################################

Database stores, retrieves and manages the data that makes everything work.
But what happens when some thing goes wrong i.e. sudden crash, network error or multiple users trying to update the same information simultaneously.
How does the database prevent chaos and keep your data safe and correct.
That’s where a crucial set of principles known as ACID properties comes in.

ACID principles are the fundamental rules that guarantee reliability and integrity in many database systems.
ACID stands for Atomicity,Consistency,Isolation and Durability.
These properties ensure that even when things go wrong, our data remains accurate, trustworthy, and consistent.

Database transaction is a sequence of operations performed as a single, logical unit of work.
For example, transferring money from one bank account to another involves at least two operations.
Debiting money from one account and crediting it to another. 
For the transfer to be valid, both these operations must succeed. 
If one fails, the entire transaction must fail as if it never happened. 
ACID properties are specifically designed to govern how these transactions behave.

1.Atomicity — All or Nothing
----------------------------
Atomicity indicates that a Database transaction must be treated as a single, indivisible unit of work.
Think of it as an atomic operation and it cannot be broken down into smaller parts from an external perspective.
A transaction either completes fully, with all its operations successful, or it fails entirely, leaving the database unchanged.
There’s no middle ground.

Example: Consider the scenario of sending money. 
If your account gets debited, but the system crashes before other's account gets credited.
Atomicity ensures the debit from your account is rolled back so that no money vanishes into thin air.

2.Consistency — Staying Valid
-----------------------------
Consistency ensures that every transaction moves the database from one valid state to another valid state.
To ensure the Consistency, Database must always follow all rules.
1.Constraints (Primary Key, Foreign Key, UNIQUE, NOT NULL, CHECK)
2.Business rules
3.Triggers
4.Data type rules

If a transaction violates any rule,The database rejects it and rolls it back so that the database is never left in an invalid state.

Consistency prevents negative balances.
Consistency protected : No orphan orders can exist 
Consistency ensured : Duplicate data prevented

3.Isolation — Working Separately
--------------------------------
When multiple transactions occur concurrently, Isolation ensures they don’t interfere with each other’s intermediate, possibly incomplete, states. 
Each transaction feels like it’s running alone on the database.

Example:Consider the scenario of Booking System.
Isolation ensures that the system processes one request completely, preventing others from double-booking.

4 Durability — Changes That Stick
---------------------------------
Once a transaction has been successfully completed, the changes made to the database are permanent.
The changes will survive any subsequent system crash, power outage or other failures.

Example: Consider the scenario of an online purchase and your order is confirmed. 
Moments later, the server crashes. 
Thanks to Durability, when the system comes back online, order information will still be there.
